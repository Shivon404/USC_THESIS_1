Nakadungog ka na ba bahin sa Urban legend sa Higante nga Goldfish sa Cagayan de Oro? Aw, ang Sugbo dunay kaugalingong katugbang, ang Kugtong.

Ang Kugtong usa ka ilado nga leyenda sa dakbayan sa Lapu-Lapu. Sumala sa urban legend, ang Kugtong usa ka higanteng isda nga grupo sa mga tawo nga nagpuyo ubos sa usa ka kompanya sa paggaling. Ang uban nag-ingon nga ang isda makatulon sa usa ka tawo nga tibuok pinaagi sa iyang mga ngipon nga nagisi sa unod ug mga labaha nga himbis. Nagtuo sila nga ang mga isda gi-mutate gikan sa mga biological waste nga produkto gikan sa milling company.

May mga tawo nga nagtuo nga swerte ang isda, hinungdan nga giatiman pag-ayo sa mga tag-iya sa milling company ang Kugtong aron magmalampuson ang ilang negosyo.

Ang mga Cebuano ganahan og maayong horror story. Ang mosunod nga urban legend kay gikan sa University of San Carlos Downtown Campus. Matod nila usa ka estudyante nga gihinganlan og Minda Mora ang naghasol gihapon sa unibersidad hangtod karon tungod sa iyang trahedya nga gidangatan.

Ang leyenda nag-ingon nga si Minda Mora, usa ka promising nga estudyante nga mahilig mag-perform, gilugos ug gipatay sa daghang mga security personnel. Ang lawas sa kabus nga tinun-an giingong gilubong sa USC Cultural Center. Nagtinguha sa pagpanimalos alang sa iyang makalilisang nga kamatayon, nagpadayon gihapon siya sa mga hawanan sa Unibersidad.

mfu7um,Philippines,College— Should I Stay or Should I Go?,"A few months ago I left California during the pandemic to come to Cebu to live with my grandmother. It was a win in certain aspects: I was trying to get out of a toxic household, escape homelessness with my mom about to kick me out, and I’d be able to keep my lola (i call mama, who i love dearly and has raised me as her child) company and have access to the privilege of three meals a day. 
I graduated high school in 2019 and was accepted into my top colleges there including UCLA & UCI. However, I was very close to not being able to graduate on time as I started to fall apart in some ways, got pulled out during my senior year of high school due to personal reasons and ended up in hospitals and treatment. I ended up having to take a gap year and spent the last two years in and out of treatment. I’m not doing that great now but I’m grateful to be in a much more manageable place but I think it’s mainly due to the fact that I’m out of the environment that made living so hellish. 
COLLEGE has been a huge thing weighing on my mind and I’ve felt like a failure and disappointment being so “late” to start. And I’m scared I might have to delay it another year but I’m trying my best to get it started this coming fall because my mama really wants to see me graduate before she passes. And I want her to see me accomplish that, too. 

My best options for college currently are going back to California for community college or enrolling at University of San Carlos in Cebu.

Admitting directly into my “dream” schools isn’t really an option anymore. I was completely a mess and ended up not even deferring my admission to the schools I worried SO much about not being accepted to and even paid the fees for my intent to register. And that SUCKS ASS because the opportunity to get my education going AND DORM to live away from my immediate family was right in front of me. But of course I also can’t afford it, fear debt and loans, & probably don’t want to risk paying all THAT only to have to drop out because of my inability to handle the load as a full time student and juggle an annoyingly debilitating condition. So, community college would probably be my best option as it’d be significantly cheaper and I can eventually transfer. However, housing would be a huge issue. Cost of living is crazy expensive and it makes me wanna cry honestly lol.

A few months ago I left California during the pandemic to come to Cebu to live with my grandmother. It was a win in certain aspects: I was trying to get out of a toxic household, escape homelessness with my mom about to kick me out, and I’d be able to keep my lola (i call mama, who i love dearly and has raised me as her child) company and have access to the privilege of three meals a day. 
I graduated high school in 2019 and was accepted into my top colleges there including UCLA & UCI. However, I was very close to not being able to graduate on time as I started to fall apart in some ways, got pulled out during my senior year of high school due to personal reasons and ended up in hospitals and treatment. I ended up having to take a gap year and spent the last two years in and out of treatment. I’m not doing that great now but I’m grateful to be in a much more manageable place but I think it’s mainly due to the fact that I’m out of the environment that made living so hellish. 
COLLEGE has been a huge thing weighing on my mind and I’ve felt like a failure and disappointment being so “late” to start. And I’m scared I might have to delay it another year but I’m trying my best to get it started this coming fall because my mama really wants to see me graduate before she passes. And I want her to see me accomplish that, too. 

My best options for college currently are going back to California for community college or enrolling at University of San Carlos in Cebu.

Admitting directly into my “dream” schools isn’t really an option anymore. I was completely a mess and ended up not even deferring my admission to the schools I worried SO much about not being accepted to and even paid the fees for my intent to register. And that SUCKS ASS because the opportunity to get my education going AND DORM to live away from my immediate family was right in front of me. But of course I also can’t afford it, fear debt and loans, & probably don’t want to risk paying all THAT only to have to drop out because of my inability to handle the load as a full time student and juggle an annoyingly debilitating condition. So, community college would probably be my best option as it’d be significantly cheaper and I can eventually transfer. However, housing would be a huge issue. Cost of living is crazy expensive and it makes me wanna cry honestly lol.

1jh2bdf,Cebu,30 4th-Year CS Students of the University of San Carlos Held Back From Graduating,"Original post and students' first-hand experiences here: [https://imgur.com/a/quUxplW](https://imgur.com/a/quUxplW)

Credits to Today's Carolinian:

30 4th-year Computer Science (CS) students of the University of San Carlos were on track for graduation this school year but were held back due to the unapproved petition of Thesis 2 for the second semester of A.Y. 2024-2025.

Thesis 2 is a course to be taken after the completion of Thesis 1, where the latter involves students proposing their thesis papers, and the former is for the presentation of such papers to conferences and the submission of its hardbound copy. This course is regularly offered in the first semester, but as practiced in previous years, it may also be offered off-semester through a petition that requires a minimum of 20 students.

According to the students, many withdrew from taking Thesis 2 in the first semester after being advised by their Thesis teacher, who is also the chair of the Department of Computer, Information Sciences, and Mathematics (DCISM), to drop the course and re-enroll in the next semester if they are not ready.

The students, who were finishing implementations of their papers and seeking conferences at the time, chose to drop the course as they feared failing the course due to complications that may invalidate their theses and hinder their graduation by the end of the academic year. An enrolled student who would not receive an acceptance notification from a research conference or finish the entire thesis would incur a failing grade.

During the second semester enrollment period last January 3 - 9, 2025, a petition to offer Thesis 2 was initiated in ISMIS, USC’s student information system.

This petition was signed by 34 CS students. Among them, 6 have already presented at conferences and 13 have received acceptance letters for their papers.

On January 9, the students were informed that the chances of Thesis 2 being offered this semester were slim.

“\[The announcement\] made a lot of us pretty anxious about what would happen \[…\] since we were expecting for \[Thesis 2\] to be offered, just like how it was in the previous years,” one of the students explained.

The department had expressed concerns about the limited faculty due to full teaching loads as well as room availability. In response to this issue, students have proactively sought three potential faculty members who were willing to handle the course, one of which was a significant contributor to the students’ thesis, while the other two were PhD holders, but such efforts were turned down as the chair mentioned that is not in the students’ power to decide which faculty member handles the course.

On January 13, students were sent a Google spreadsheet link to identify students who were eligible to take Thesis 2. New conditions were given other than the hitherto only prerequisite, which was Thesis 1: a certificate/endorsement from their respective adviser confirming 80% completion of their thesis, or acceptance of their paper to an international research conference.

Despite this, most of the students already had their acceptance letters and were ready to present.

On January 16, students were notified that the petition was turned into a tutorial, and only those who have presented, published, and are ready for hardbound are allowed to take it, which reduced it to only a select few.

As communication with the department chair was no longer productive for the students, they escalated the matters to the School of Arts and Sciences Dean on January 17.

When approaching the Dean in his office and requesting an audience regarding the issue, students were just asked to send him the letter, which contained the signatures of the students and their parents, via email. He notified the department chair with the letter, but ultimately abided with her decision. In her response, the chair mentioned additional requirements: no overload and no simultaneous enrollment.

The students then approached the registrar, as the department chair and subject coordinator informed them that the registrar required that they complete 80% of their thesis or be accepted to a conference in order to meet enrollment requirements. However, they were told by the registrar that such a directive was not followed and that they only adhered to what was stated in the student handbook.

According to the students, all the new conditions were not made with their knowledge or prior consultation, with no clarity on what existing academic policy this was based on. Students found the changes questionable, especially as they were not given any proper explanation beforehand and at held meetings. Additionally, the added requirements eliminated everyone except four.

Matters were forwarded to the Vice President of Academic Affairs (VPAA), who students managed to hold a meeting with. This only resulted in the VPAA pushing the concern back to the department chair, as well as denying the request of a notarization, signature, or any tangible proof of resolution that students will be able to take Thesis 2 once conditions are fulfilled.

“Throughout the entire time, our biggest concern was that essentially, every time \[the issue\] escalated, there was no actual work being done,” a 4th year CS student expressed.

Students were able to gain legal consultation and a letter from a lawyer that detailed the concerns of the students with legal grounds. However, it was never sent because they thought it best to hold a meeting first with the administration in the hopes that the issue could be resolved amicably.

Apart from the delay in graduation, repercussions faced by students because of this issue include added financial burden, risk of losing Latin honors, and losing job offers that require students to graduate in a certain period of time. For the students who were eligible for a tutorial, they had to pay significantly more than the fees of a petitioned course.

Currently, students have yet to receive a clear explanation regarding the issue. Many remain apprehensive about speaking up, citing concerns about possible retaliation.

On March 16, 2025, Today’s Carolinian reached out to the department chair regarding clarifications on the creation of the prerequisite requirements and channels the policy change was disseminated on. As of writing, there has been no response.",160,0.99,48.0,1742624982.0,2025-03-22 14:29:42,NoodleSushi,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cebu/comments/1jh2bdf/30_4thyear_cs_students_of_the_university_of_san/,https://reddit.com/r/Cebu/comments/1jh2bdf/30_4thyear_cs_students_of_the_university_of_san/,post,"30 4th-Year CS Students of the University of San Carlos Held Back From Graduating Original post and students' first-hand experiences here: [https://imgur.com/a/quUxplW](https://imgur.com/a/quUxplW)

1d1nhk7,Cebu,international student living on $300 a month in cebu?,"Planning on moving back to Cebu soon cause I just got accepted to the University of San Carlos (BS in Computer Science). I speak bisaya fluently of course, only been here for 5 years at the US because of high school lol. 

Thing is, I also got accepted at a local college here but I am not too keen on taking debt just to get (probably) the same education quality as in Cebu. Though I am also scared of living alone in another country away from my parents and I definitely don't want to struggle lol

$300 USD is the only amount of money my parents are willing to give me every month to live alone (This money is for everything, rent, food, utilities, etc.) Can I make it through 4 years on this monthly budget? 

They are firm on this and is actually higher than the initial amount they were gonna give me. I have funds from 1 gap year where I just worked, but its for tuition, my plane ticket, and for emergency purposes.

1cp56gv,Cebu,How was your Gabii sa Kabilin 2024 Beloved Bisaya experience?,"First time nako musuway gabii, ug usa ra gyud ka route akong nahuman - ang Route 1: Fort San Pedro, Casa Gorordo, University of San Carlos (USC) Museum, Cebu Normal University (CNU) Museum, Rizal Memorial Library and Museum. 6 routes man ata tanan.

Overall, nindot ra baya, pero kuwang ra gyud kaayo ang 6 hours kung ganahan ka mu-visit sa tanan lugar. Kada place imong ma-visit, tatakan (with picture sa location) nila imong ticket. Nasulit ra ang Php 300 kay mura rag igo gi-plete sa airconditioned buses ug sa mga museums. Kalas lang gyud oras maghuwat for the next bus. Anyway, I'm planning to try again next  year.

Ang Fort San Pedro, gi-skip nako kay kadaghan na ko naka-adto sauna.

Ang Casa Gorordo, bati ibisita sa gabii, kay dili kaayo hayag ang mga suga. Naa pud parts wa kaayo suga. Dili kaayo nimo ma-appreciate ang mga items on display.

Ang USC, daghan2x sad interesting items, especially sa religious artifacts. Ang earthenware part, medyo boring ra for me. Mas daghan ang display sa National Museum of the Philippines - Cebu, though wa ni labot sa akong route karon. Naka-visit ra ko before. Ang Ifugao section, so-so ra. Ang katong animals section, OK ra sab. Hastang daku-a man diay sa stuffed Philippine Eagle. Mas dako pas akong nawng. Naa pud toy squirrel on display. Nakapanguntana ko, ""Naa ba gud diy squirrel sa Cebu?"". Haha.

Ang CNU, dili puwede mag-picture2x, pero naa sad mga very old World War items gi-display. Medyo kuyaw lang ang floor kay naay uban parts mu-uyog, labi na kung kusog kaayo ang imong pagtamak. Murag ilisanan gyud ilang salog. I would have loved to spend more time here, especially mag-basa2x sa mga war-related writeups, pero decided to move fast, kay daghan waiting sa gawas.

Ang Rizal Memorial Library and Museum, wala kaayo items in display, more on sa theme sya sa event - ang Beloved Bisaya. Naay mga mga tarp gipapilit about Ignacio Alcina, ang pari nga nagsuwat ug libro about Visayas. Also, TIL from one of the tarps:

>the Bisaya means ""a happy man"" or ""a man of fine and pleasant disposition"" which is derived from its root word aya, saya, or caya, all pertaining to a ""person of fine disposition"" or ""a pleasant and happy person"".

Sa next floor, medyo boring. Naay mga display on Sinulog pictures, mostly kinuha sa mga photographers during Sinulog. Sa lower floor, naay mga artists didto nag-sketch sa mga dagway sa mga tao.

o6z1qa,studentsph,(USC Cebu) Advertising Arts Questions,"Hello po! I am a G12 graduate who is about to enroll to college. I live in Mindanao, and initially, I would want to pursue a course that tackles more on art and design most especially in digital arts, to which na stumble ko yung Advertising Arts. Although there isn't a sufficient course in digital arts dito, me and my parents agreed to try univrtsities outside of Mindanao, and picked the closest one in Cebu.

USC offers Advertising Arts, and I was pretty much pumped for this course, since I love creating digital drawings, illustrations and such in a large scale. Pero there's this thought in my head that keeps popping up when I first saw the curriculum and courses offered. I was reluctant as ""Advertising,"" is certainly ambiguous, since I thought, at first, that Advertising Arts will only tackle on digital arts and not on any other media (i.e. Photography, Poster Campaigns etc). Even though I would want to have a career at least remotely related to Character Design, Illustration, Concept Art etc; will this course suffice in helping me learn the skills I need in order to reach that kind of career? 

Sorry if I'm a bit poetic, haha, pero I'm really having trouble wrapping around the art course I want; since my choices are very limited, I believe Advertising Arts is the closest thing I can enroll with. But I keep panicking about the ""thesis"" thing in the course, as I have only read about something about campaign posters and advertisements and such, is there, like, a choice to pursue something like an animation, story or whatever in the ""thesis?"" (I'm not really knowledgeable about how it works)

Another thing I question is if Multimedia Arts better for me than Advertising?

There may be instances where the 20 pesos will be sent in groups, so please check your Gcash notifications, as they may not alert you through text message. Lastly, we'd greatly appreciate if you could share this survey to other friends and family members who fit the criteria.

Your voluntary assistance in advancing our knowledge of the topic would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!

mfua6q,college,Undergrad in Philippine University or California Community College?,"A few months ago I left the US during the pandemic to come to the Philippines to live with my grandmother. It was a win in certain aspects: I was trying to get out of a toxic household, escape homelessness with my mom about to kick me out, and I’d be able to keep my grandmother (i call mama, who i love dearly and has raised me as her child) company and have access to the privilege of three meals a day. 
I graduated high school in 2019 and was accepted into my top colleges there including UCLA & UCI. However, I was very close to not being able to graduate on time as I started to fall apart in some ways, got pulled out during my senior year of high school due to personal reasons and ended up in hospitals and treatment. I ended up having to take a gap year and spent the last two years in and out of treatment. I’m not doing that great now but I’m grateful to be in a much more manageable place but I think it’s mainly due to the fact that I’m out of the environment that made living so hellish. 
COLLEGE has been a huge thing weighing on my mind and I’ve felt like a failure and disappointment being so “late” to start. And I’m scared I might have to delay it another year but I’m trying my best to get it started this coming fall because my mama really wants to see me graduate before she passes. And I want her to see me accomplish that, too. 

My best options for college currently are going back to California for community college or enrolling at University of San Carlos in Cebu.

Admitting directly into my “dream” schools isn’t really an option anymore. I was completely a mess and ended up not even deferring my admission to the schools I worried SO much about not being accepted to and even paid the fees for my intent to register. And that SUCKS ASS because the opportunity to get my education going AND DORM to live away from my immediate family was right in front of me. But of course I also can’t afford it, fear debt and loans, & probably don’t want to risk paying all THAT only to have to drop out because of my inability to handle the load as a full time student and juggle an annoyingly debilitating condition. So, community college would probably be my best option as it’d be significantly cheaper and I can eventually transfer. However, housing would be a huge issue. Cost of living is crazy expensive and it makes me wanna cry honestly lol.
By staying in the Philippines I wouldn’t have to worry about housing and other expenses. But I would have far less access to the resources and treatment I need. I try my best to stay at a functioning level but worry for when I struggle. I’m also concerned about how my degree or credits would transfer to the US or when I try to obtain a job. I often hear a community college education from the US is better than the universities here. 

I’ve honestly been so confused on what to do. I can’t afford to delay my decisions feeling paralyzed and try to avoid this even longer. I want to get my education going. Should I stay or should I go? Stay in the Philippines with an education system I’m really unsure about with a degree in a major (Psychology) that would probably get me nowhere here or do I return to the US for community college but struggle with housing and that cost of living?

No uniform during your undergrad years, unless if you're gonna take up medical courses that would require students to wear uniform on most days. Business courses also require corporate attire for 1 day, as a practice. 

Most colleges in the university have no classes on Monday, because they use it as a free day to catch up on studying, meet up for group work/fieldwork, work on your co-curriculars or an extra day to rest especially if you had a quiz/class on Saturday. Students are really encouraged to be involved in co-curricular activites/joining orgs, para hindi din puro academics lang. 

Even if SU is a Christian school, they welcome all students from different walks of life, race and religion. Wala kaming uniform, yung uniform ko nga is shorts, tshirts, tsinelas. The school is overall chill and environmentally friendly, coz the university is so full of acacia trees and is situated beside the sea. 

As for academics, diskarte talaga siya. Center of excellence ang SU sa medical courses like Nursing, MT and PT, but maximize any opportunity to succeed and shine in school whenever you can. I graduated with a liberal arts degree, pero I was also active in the school orgs para may scholarship din ako. You can also work parttime as a student assistant. And during my stay, grabe talaga yung influence nila in helping students appreciate art, music and culture. Most local artists in Dumaguete are students/graduates from SU, so they're trying to make the city a lively cultural spot. 

Overall, I enjoyed my stay in Silliman. I was able to focus in my academics because the less yung pollution, university-city yung Dumaguete, and I got to make friends from ppl all over the world and still keep in touch and know local artists. Sa sobrang liit ng Dumaguete at ng university, you get to know everyone in just a short period.
