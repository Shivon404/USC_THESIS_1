1ikcddr,Philippines,Early Exposure and The Financiers Behind the Pre-Election Period Campaigns (Part 1: The Partylists),"Last September, I posted a [prelude](https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/1ffmn47/discovering_the_political_advertisers_of_the/) covering the political donors na naglabas ng kanilang mga pera to air premature campaign ads of several candidates ilang buwan bago magsimula ang official campaign period. Since then, mas dumami na ang mga kandidatong nagpaparamdam... not just through commercials, but also through fluff news articles (hello Villars!) and TV programming (too many to mention). So bago ang simula ng campaign period para sa mga senador at partylists, allow me to give a brief rundown ng mga early exposure candidates sa partylist system starting with...

[From left to right: FPJ Panday Bayanihan Partylist 2nd nominee Mark Patron, 1st nominee Brian Poe Llamanzares, Sen. Grace Poe, 3rd nominee Hiyas Dolor \(Avito Dalan of PNA\)](https://preview.redd.it/xxogm9db4uhe1.jpg?width=3071&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cf60247ed8731cba2b33b91b7f01c650f41f801b)

# FPJ PANDAY BAYANIHAN

First nominee: Brian Poe Llamanzares. That's all you really need to know about this partylist: a front to get Grace's son into legislation, and it'll most likely work dahil sa paggamit kay FPJ and everything related to him. Ginamit pa ang half-tita na si Lovi in this [ad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ree7T_yBoMM) that was paid by... **FPJ Productions, Inc.** Lahat ng revenue galing sa mga movies na nasa Youtube + yung deal nila with GMA, part of that must have went to pay for their 30 and 60 second commercials to be aired.

[Sulong Batang Quiapo Partylist \(Facebook\)](https://preview.redd.it/c1t3s7hi4uhe1.jpg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3167c015a54e08221e7d442bd2ba3c591dc0605e)

# BATANG QUIAPO (Sulong mga Batang Quiapo)

Speaking of name recall that uses a popular show starring Coco Martin (hindi ito yung unang beses nangyari and may upuan na nga sa Kongreso), hangad ng partylist na ito ang proteksyon ng mga vendors (not the first for-vendors partylist na nagparamdam during this pre-campaign period). Paid [ad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXNpkcHh4qc) by **Golden Tiger Shipping Agencies, Inc.**, only founded in 2022, and hindi ko alam ang connection between those two. What's even worse is that yung [first nominee](https://www.instagram.com/mediazofia/) ay isang social media influencer at kakagraduate lang from DLSU last year with a degree in Biology! Make it make sense!

[Incumbent AKO Bicol Partylist Rep. Zaldy Co in 2022 \(House Press and Public Affairs Bureau\)](https://preview.redd.it/j8kdy5qk4uhe1.jpg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7476b7ef7454f817c921a5f9d8d5502e43991b42)

# AKO BICOL (Ako Bicol Political Party)

A mainstay in the partylist system and I'm sure you've seen their **self-financed** [ad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a91PW19lyuY) with Jericho Rosales at least once already the past few days. Allow me to introduce incumbent representative Zaldy Co, CEO ng Sunwest Group and Chairman ng Misibis Bay Resort. Maraming kontrobersya ang sangkot siya over the past year including ang [involvement ng Sunwest sa Pharmally and DepEd laptops](https://www.gmanetwork.com/news/topstories/content/897239/villanueva-hits-back-at-zaldy-co-your-company-is-linked-to-pharmally-deped-laptop-controversies/story/). As for kung anong nagawa nila sa Bicol, [flood control funding](https://verafiles.org/articles/fact-check-co-falsely-claims-no-billion-peso-funding-for-flood-control-in-bicol) dispute kung saan may Php 1.3B allocation ang DPWH noong 2023 which Co claims na hindi umabot sa bilyon.

Also, I got this comment from a Redditor galing sa r/ChikaPH in that Echo ad:

>Taga Bicol ako but never to Ako Bicol!! Ilang years na sila wala naman sila nagagawa sa Bicol region, bulok pa rin kalsada pa-Bicol. Malaki lang pakinabang nila Zaldy Co, Christopher Co na may quarry sa Albay, Garbin, Jill Bongalon na mga trapo din. NEVER TO THEM! PLEASE !! WAG NYO SILA IBOBOTO. Kawawa na ang Mayon Volcano, Kawawa na ang Albay dahil sa mga Co na yan! Tapos anak pa nyan ni Christopher yung Claudine Co na out of touch at feelingera alam naman nating lahat san galing ang pera nila.

# HEAL PH (Health Alliance PH)

Sa [digital ad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11eXmsu1o44) ng partylist, nandoon ang first 3 nominees nila: Dr. Jondi Flavier, Dr. Eric Tayag (former DOH Undersecretary), and Ret. Gen. Bennie de Leon (former DENR Undersecretary). In their website, they've aligned themselves with Senate candidate Dr. Willie Ong and for a partylist advocating for universal healthcare, the main nominees have legitimacy on their background and cause.

[From: Incumbent ACT-CIS Rep. Edvic Yap, Incumbent ACT-CIS Rep. Jocelyn Tulfo, Sen. Raffy Tulfo and 3rd nominee former Rep. Jeffrey Soriano \(ACT-CIS Facebook\)](https://preview.redd.it/tr52is5i5uhe1.png?width=2879&format=png&auto=webp&s=6754e88a39e6999d3f9c0025e50229af28281892)

# ACT-CIS (Anti-Crime and Terrorism-Community Involvement and Support)

Ang partylist na may pinakamaraming boto sa huling 2 eleksyon, thanks in part to the involvement of the Tulfos, susubukang panatilihin ang kanilang 3 puwesto sa Kongreso with all their incumbents going for re-election pati na rin si Jeffrey Soriano na nag-resign nung 2023 to give way to Erwin Tulfo. I mean what more to say about this partylist? Their [ads](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Espg8IwYZPc) (the same one na ginamit nung 2022) are being paid by **Earth Yard Corp.**, kung saan ang general manager nito ay si Evy Yap who's gotta be related to first nominee Cong. Edvic. Did I forget to mention the Yap brothers are a political dynasty sa Kongreso?

[TUPAD Partylist 2nd nominee Bayani Agbayani \(Bayani Agbayani's Facebook\)](https://preview.redd.it/7govwot36uhe1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c4ceb64d0ebbc91c3b16f86ba8cfa0539f0cb207)

# TUPAD

Bayani Agbayani is the frontman for this partylist as seen in this [ad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC99ttvz5-I), pero siya lang ang second nominee. That goes to Rossini Stallion Mikaelo Lu, whose only public information is passing the licensure examinations for real estate broker in 2013. Walang gaanong information from their socials aside from their promise of instant ayuda and trabaho.

# 1PACMAN (One Patriotic Coalition of Marginalized Nationals)

Marketed themselves with the help of Manny Pacquiao, who appears in this [ad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLQ8oj5gRIg) along with a few other athletes including Iris Tolenada of Capital1 (the polar opposite of the partylist's full name and advocacy to marginalized sectors). Bakit ko na-single out si Iris? Mikee Romero's maxed out his 3 terms sa Kongreso, so ang papalit as its first nominee ay ang anak and Capital1 co-owner Milka. Bobby Pacquiao is the second nominee, and hindi lang siya ang Pacquiao na second nominee (hello Jinkee sa MPBL!) Ads are being paid for by 6th nominee, **Atty. Richard Von de Castro**, director ng Legal and Human Resources ng Capital1 Solar Energy Corp.

# ANGKASANGGA (Ang Kasangga ng Mangunguma-Owa Mangunguma)

Kinda obvious what this partylist is a wordplay for: Angkas, from its' CEO George Royeca as the first nominee to the use of their bikers in the [ad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHpdlH1sA_w) featuring Vice Ganda. This feels like another 1PACMAN situation where iba yung minamarket nila to their supposed advocacy, which is towards farmers as provided in their full partylist name. Naalala niyo ba yung nangyari sa Cainta Junction just a few days ago? [Sila yun](https://www.reddit.com/r/pinoy/comments/1igm3cr/kamote_partylist_assemble/).

# BBM (Bangon Bagong Minero)

Walang halalan kung walang partylist na may wordplay sa kung sino man ang nasa kapangyarihan, and BBM checks the box for this elections. They first tried their hand with Toni Gonzaga as the celebrity endorser through billboards, but it just didn't work at nag-pivot sila towards [TV ads](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wS5ZJlSu3oI) with odd takes of *If You're Happy* as the jingle. May relation ang first nominee na si Carlo Antonio Co kay Antonio ""Tony"" L. Co and most likely does [business ](https://www.threads.net/@cap_co_85)for Carrascal Nickel Corp., whose [operations in Surigao del Norte was once shut down](https://www.abs-cbn.com/business/02/02/17/lopez-suspends-closes-several-mines-in-environment-crackdown) by the late DENR Sec. Gina Lopez in 2017. Those ads were paid by **Paseo de Polaris Corp.**, a registered SEC company since 2013, pero halos walang public information about the donor.

# VENDORS (Vendors Samahan ng mga Maninindang Pilipino)

The first partylist to really make its presence felt sa pre-campaign period through their [ad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCplNNQ-0n8) as early as September last year and the inclusion of 4th nominee Diwata, only to lay low since then. Registered SEC company din ang **Vendors Alliance for Progress (LuzViMin), Inc.** that paid to have that ad aired during that time, pero wala nang iba pang public information.

It's not like the partylist system is already fucked like it's been for some time now: political dynasties, businessmen, at ngayon social media influencers. Anyways, feel free to share more information about these partylists and sana makatulong itong guide sa darating na midterm elections. I'll be posting part 2 with the Senatorial candidates bukas or sa Monday at the very latest.","early exposure and the financiers behind the pre-election period campaigns (part 1: the partylists) last september, i posted a [prelude](https://www.reddit.com/r/philippines/comments/1ffmn47/discovering_the_political_advertisers_of_the/) covering the political donors na naglabas ng kanilang mga pera to air premature campaign ads of several candidates ilang buwan bago magsimula ang official campaign period. since then, mas dumami na ang mga kandidatong nagpaparamdam... not just through commercials, but also through fluff news articles (hello villars!) and tv programming (too many to mention). so bago ang simula ng campaign period para sa mga senador at partylists, allow me to give a brief rundown ng mga early exposure candidates sa partylist system starting with...

bayani agbayani is the frontman for this partylist as seen in this [ad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cc99ttvz5-i), pero siya lang ang second nominee. that goes to rossini stallion mikaelo lu, whose only public information is passing the licensure examinations for real estate broker in 2013. walang gaanong information from their socials aside from their promise of instant ayuda and trabaho.

# 1pacman (one patriotic coalition of marginalized nationals)

marketed themselves with the help of manny pacquiao, who appears in this [ad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plq8oj5grig) along with a few other athletes including iris tolenada of capital1 (the polar opposite of the partylist's full name and advocacy to marginalized sectors). bakit ko na-single out si iris? mikee romero's maxed out his 3 terms sa kongreso, so ang papalit as its first nominee ay ang anak and capital1 co-owner milka. bobby pacquiao is the second nominee, and hindi lang siya ang pacquiao na second nominee (hello jinkee sa mpbl!) ads are being paid for by 6th nominee, **atty. richard von de castro**, director ng legal and human resources ng capital1 solar energy corp.

# angkasangga (ang kasangga ng mangunguma-owa mangunguma)

kinda obvious what this partylist is a wordplay for: angkas, from its' ceo george royeca as the first nominee to the use of their bikers in the [ad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhpdlh1sa_w) featuring vice ganda. this feels like another 1pacman situation where iba yung minamarket nila to their supposed advocacy, which is towards farmers as provided in their full partylist name. naalala niyo ba yung nangyari sa cainta junction just a few days ago? [sila yun](https://www.reddit.com/r/pinoy/comments/1igm3cr/kamote_partylist_assemble/).

# bbm (bangon bagong minero)

walang halalan kung walang partylist na may wordplay sa kung sino man ang nasa kapangyarihan, and bbm checks the box for this elections. they first tried their hand with toni gonzaga as the celebrity endorser through billboards, but it just didn't work at nag-pivot sila towards [tv ads](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ws5zjlsu3oi) with odd takes of *if you're happy* as the jingle. may relation ang first nominee na si carlo antonio co kay antonio ""tony"" l. co and most likely does [business ](https://www.threads.net/@cap_co_85)for carrascal nickel corp., whose [operations in surigao del norte was once shut down](https://www.abs-cbn.com/business/02/02/17/lopez-suspends-closes-several-mines-in-environment-crackdown) by the late denr sec. gina lopez in 2017. those ads were paid by **paseo de polaris corp.**, a registered sec company since 2013, pero halos walang public information about the donor.

# vendors (vendors samahan ng mga maninindang pilipino)

the first partylist to really make its presence felt sa pre-campaign period through their [ad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocplnnq-0n8) as early as september last year and the inclusion of 4th nominee diwata, only to lay low since then. registered sec company din ang **vendors alliance for progress (luzvimin), inc.** that paid to have that ad aired during that time, pero wala nang iba pang public information.

it's not like the partylist system is already fucked like it's been for some time now: political dynasties, businessmen, at ngayon social media influencers. anyways, feel free to share more information about these partylists and sana makatulong itong guide sa darating na midterm elections. i'll be posting part 2 with the senatorial candidates bukas or sa monday at the very latest.",16,0.91,3.0,1738980574.0,2025-02-08 10:09:34,NameConnect4519,https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/1ikcddr/early_exposure_and_the_financiers_behind_the/,https://reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/1ikcddr/early_exposure_and_the_financiers_behind_the/,university of san carlos,True,18,39,24,0,81,"['bisaya', 'tagalog', 'conyo']",4,81,post,0.2638533592640755,0.3191368137469056,positive,2,1,,,

Nakadungog ka na ba bahin sa Urban legend sa Higante nga Goldfish sa Cagayan de Oro? Aw, ang Sugbo dunay kaugalingong katugbang, ang Kugtong.

Ang Kugtong usa ka ilado nga leyenda sa dakbayan sa Lapu-Lapu. Sumala sa urban legend, ang Kugtong usa ka higanteng isda nga grupo sa mga tawo nga nagpuyo ubos sa usa ka kompanya sa paggaling. Ang uban nag-ingon nga ang isda makatulon sa usa ka tawo nga tibuok pinaagi sa iyang mga ngipon nga nagisi sa unod ug mga labaha nga himbis. Nagtuo sila nga ang mga isda gi-mutate gikan sa mga biological waste nga produkto gikan sa milling company.

May mga tawo nga nagtuo nga swerte ang isda, hinungdan nga giatiman pag-ayo sa mga tag-iya sa milling company ang Kugtong aron magmalampuson ang ilang negosyo.

Ang leyenda nag-ingon nga si Minda Mora, usa ka promising nga estudyante nga mahilig mag-perform, gilugos ug gipatay sa daghang mga security personnel. Ang lawas sa kabus nga tinun-an giingong gilubong sa USC Cultural Center. Nagtinguha sa pagpanimalos alang sa iyang makalilisang nga kamatayon, nagpadayon gihapon siya sa mga hawanan sa Unibersidad.

Ang mga sikat nga Filipino urban legend hapit kanunay naglakip og aswang. Ang Sugbo adunay aswang nga numero sa ngalan nga Lily. Sumala sa urban legend, si Lily usa ka mangkukulam nga milamoy sa mga tawo sa tungang gabii. Siya giingon nga labing gamhanan kung modan-ag ang bulan.

I think ganahan mo matulog karung gabii na naay suga 👏👏","cebuano myths 1. ang kugtong


nakadungog ka na ba bahin sa urban legend sa higante nga goldfish sa cagayan de oro? aw, ang sugbo dunay kaugalingong katugbang, ang kugtong.

ang kugtong usa ka ilado nga leyenda sa dakbayan sa lapu-lapu. sumala sa urban legend, ang kugtong usa ka higanteng isda nga grupo sa mga tawo nga nagpuyo ubos sa usa ka kompanya sa paggaling. ang uban nag-ingon nga ang isda makatulon sa usa ka tawo nga tibuok pinaagi sa iyang mga ngipon nga nagisi sa unod ug mga labaha nga himbis. nagtuo sila nga ang mga isda gi-mutate gikan sa mga biological waste nga produkto gikan sa milling company.

may mga tawo nga nagtuo nga swerte ang isda, hinungdan nga giatiman pag-ayo sa mga tag-iya sa milling company ang kugtong aron magmalampuson ang ilang negosyo.

mfu7um,Philippines,College— Should I Stay or Should I Go?,"A few months ago I left California during the pandemic to come to Cebu to live with my grandmother. It was a win in certain aspects: I was trying to get out of a toxic household, escape homelessness with my mom about to kick me out, and I’d be able to keep my lola (i call mama, who i love dearly and has raised me as her child) company and have access to the privilege of three meals a day. 
I graduated high school in 2019 and was accepted into my top colleges there including UCLA & UCI. However, I was very close to not being able to graduate on time as I started to fall apart in some ways, got pulled out during my senior year of high school due to personal reasons and ended up in hospitals and treatment. I ended up having to take a gap year and spent the last two years in and out of treatment. I’m not doing that great now but I’m grateful to be in a much more manageable place but I think it’s mainly due to the fact that I’m out of the environment that made living so hellish. 
COLLEGE has been a huge thing weighing on my mind and I’ve felt like a failure and disappointment being so “late” to start. And I’m scared I might have to delay it another year but I’m trying my best to get it started this coming fall because my mama really wants to see me graduate before she passes. And I want her to see me accomplish that, too. 

My best options for college currently are going back to California for community college or enrolling at University of San Carlos in Cebu.

Admitting directly into my “dream” schools isn’t really an option anymore. I was completely a mess and ended up not even deferring my admission to the schools I worried SO much about not being accepted to and even paid the fees for my intent to register. And that SUCKS ASS because the opportunity to get my education going AND DORM to live away from my immediate family was right in front of me. But of course I also can’t afford it, fear debt and loans, & probably don’t want to risk paying all THAT only to have to drop out because of my inability to handle the load as a full time student and juggle an annoyingly debilitating condition. So, community college would probably be my best option as it’d be significantly cheaper and I can eventually transfer. However, housing would be a huge issue. Cost of living is crazy expensive and it makes me wanna cry honestly lol.
By staying in the Philippines I wouldn’t have to worry about housing and other expenses. But I would have far less access to the resources and treatment I need. I try my best to stay at a functioning level but worry for when I struggle. I’m also concerned about how my degree or credits would transfer to the US or when I try to obtain a job. I often hear a community college education from the US is better than the universities here. 

I’ve honestly been so confused on what to do. I can’t afford to delay my decisions feeling paralyzed and try to avoid this even longer. I want to get my education going. Should I stay or should I go? Stay in the Philippines with an education system I’m kinda unsure about with a degree in a major (Psychology) that would probably get me nowhere here or do I return to the US for community college but struggle with housing and that cost of living? 

I feel like I’m missing a lot more details I was meaning to include but I’m honestly tired. 
I really need some outside opinion from as many diff perspectives as I can get. Thanks in advance !!!","college— should i stay or should i go? a few months ago i left california during the pandemic to come to cebu to live with my grandmother. it was a win in certain aspects: i was trying to get out of a toxic household, escape homelessness with my mom about to kick me out, and i’d be able to keep my lola (i call mama, who i love dearly and has raised me as her child) company and have access to the privilege of three meals a day.

Credits to Today's Carolinian:

30 4th-year Computer Science (CS) students of the University of San Carlos were on track for graduation this school year but were held back due to the unapproved petition of Thesis 2 for the second semester of A.Y. 2024-2025.

Thesis 2 is a course to be taken after the completion of Thesis 1, where the latter involves students proposing their thesis papers, and the former is for the presentation of such papers to conferences and the submission of its hardbound copy. This course is regularly offered in the first semester, but as practiced in previous years, it may also be offered off-semester through a petition that requires a minimum of 20 students.

According to the students, many withdrew from taking Thesis 2 in the first semester after being advised by their Thesis teacher, who is also the chair of the Department of Computer, Information Sciences, and Mathematics (DCISM), to drop the course and re-enroll in the next semester if they are not ready.

The students, who were finishing implementations of their papers and seeking conferences at the time, chose to drop the course as they feared failing the course due to complications that may invalidate their theses and hinder their graduation by the end of the academic year. An enrolled student who would not receive an acceptance notification from a research conference or finish the entire thesis would incur a failing grade.

During the second semester enrollment period last January 3 - 9, 2025, a petition to offer Thesis 2 was initiated in ISMIS, USC’s student information system.

This petition was signed by 34 CS students. Among them, 6 have already presented at conferences and 13 have received acceptance letters for their papers.

On January 9, the students were informed that the chances of Thesis 2 being offered this semester were slim.

“\[The announcement\] made a lot of us pretty anxious about what would happen \[…\] since we were expecting for \[Thesis 2\] to be offered, just like how it was in the previous years,” one of the students explained.

The department had expressed concerns about the limited faculty due to full teaching loads as well as room availability. In response to this issue, students have proactively sought three potential faculty members who were willing to handle the course, one of which was a significant contributor to the students’ thesis, while the other two were PhD holders, but such efforts were turned down as the chair mentioned that is not in the students’ power to decide which faculty member handles the course.

On January 13, students were sent a Google spreadsheet link to identify students who were eligible to take Thesis 2. New conditions were given other than the hitherto only prerequisite, which was Thesis 1: a certificate/endorsement from their respective adviser confirming 80% completion of their thesis, or acceptance of their paper to an international research conference.

Despite this, most of the students already had their acceptance letters and were ready to present.

On January 16, students were notified that the petition was turned into a tutorial, and only those who have presented, published, and are ready for hardbound are allowed to take it, which reduced it to only a select few.

As communication with the department chair was no longer productive for the students, they escalated the matters to the School of Arts and Sciences Dean on January 17.

When approaching the Dean in his office and requesting an audience regarding the issue, students were just asked to send him the letter, which contained the signatures of the students and their parents, via email. He notified the department chair with the letter, but ultimately abided with her decision. In her response, the chair mentioned additional requirements: no overload and no simultaneous enrollment.

The students then approached the registrar, as the department chair and subject coordinator informed them that the registrar required that they complete 80% of their thesis or be accepted to a conference in order to meet enrollment requirements. However, they were told by the registrar that such a directive was not followed and that they only adhered to what was stated in the student handbook.

According to the students, all the new conditions were not made with their knowledge or prior consultation, with no clarity on what existing academic policy this was based on. Students found the changes questionable, especially as they were not given any proper explanation beforehand and at held meetings. Additionally, the added requirements eliminated everyone except four.

Matters were forwarded to the Vice President of Academic Affairs (VPAA), who students managed to hold a meeting with. This only resulted in the VPAA pushing the concern back to the department chair, as well as denying the request of a notarization, signature, or any tangible proof of resolution that students will be able to take Thesis 2 once conditions are fulfilled.

“Throughout the entire time, our biggest concern was that essentially, every time \[the issue\] escalated, there was no actual work being done,” a 4th year CS student expressed.

Students were able to gain legal consultation and a letter from a lawyer that detailed the concerns of the students with legal grounds. However, it was never sent because they thought it best to hold a meeting first with the administration in the hopes that the issue could be resolved amicably.

Apart from the delay in graduation, repercussions faced by students because of this issue include added financial burden, risk of losing Latin honors, and losing job offers that require students to graduate in a certain period of time. For the students who were eligible for a tutorial, they had to pay significantly more than the fees of a petitioned course.

Currently, students have yet to receive a clear explanation regarding the issue. Many remain apprehensive about speaking up, citing concerns about possible retaliation.

On March 16, 2025, Today’s Carolinian reached out to the department chair regarding clarifications on the creation of the prerequisite requirements and channels the policy change was disseminated on. As of writing, there has been no response.","30 4th-year cs students of the university of san carlos held back from graduating original post and students' first-hand experiences here: [https://imgur.com/a/quuxplw](https://imgur.com/a/quuxplw)

1iluvhu,Cebu,3-story sports facility to open in Apas in March,"CEBUANO entrepreneur and lawyer Augusto W. Go (AWG) is making significant investments to elevate Cebu’s sports scene.

Under AWG’s Group of Companies, Go is currently developing Magnum Sports Complex, a state-of-the-art sports facility inside Treewoods Residences, located in Sitio San Miguel, Barangay Apas, Cebu City.

Slated for completion this March, Magnum Sports Complex will be a three-story facility featuring three Fiba-standard basketball courts with Taraflex flooring and a tennis court with Tiger Turf flooring on the ground floor.

The second floor will house 10 badminton courts with Taraflex flooring, two of which can be converted into pickleball courts.

In addition to sports facilities, Magnum Sports Complex will feature a game arcade, sports bar and restaurant, gym, dance and yoga studio, lockers and showers.

The second floor will also include dedicated spaces for wall climbing, a golf simulator, a salon and spa and a snack bar, making it a comprehensive hub for both sports and recreation.

Project cost

Go said the construction of Magnum Sports Complex has a project cost of P300 million. The complex will also have 30 food kiosks and 104 total parking spaces.

A Fiba-approved basketball court meets the standards set by the International Basketball Federation (Fiba) for professional and international competitions.

Among the key features of a Fiba-approved basketball court include a court dimensions with a standard size of 28 meters long and 15 meters wide (approximately 91.9 feet × 49.2 feet). The playing surface has a high-quality, non-slip wooden or synthetic surface, such as Taraflex or hardwood.

Hoops must be 3.05 meters (10 feet) high, with Fiba-approved glass backboards (180 cm × 105 cm). The three-point line should be positioned at 6.75 meters (22.1 feet) from the basket, except in the corners, where it’s 6.6 meters (21.65 feet). The free-throw line must be placed 4.6 meters (15 feet) from the backboard.

Courts must have high-intensity lighting suitable for professional broadcasts. A digital 24-second shot clocks and visible scoreboards are also mandatory.

Go sees a strong market for sports facilities in Cebu, driven by the growing interest of the younger generation in sports and wellness.

These new investments will not only strengthen Cebu’s sports ecosystem but also drive economic growth by creating jobs and attracting sports tourism.

Go said the facility is set to empower future champions while fostering a healthier, more active community.

He hopes to see Cebu produce world-class athletes like Carlos Yulo, who won two Olympic gold medals in 2024.

Renovation

Alongside this project, Go has also announced plans to transform Cebu Coliseum into a fully air-conditioned sports facility featuring a Fiba-approved basketball court and expanded parking spaces.

With a projected investment of at least P100 million, the University of Cebu founder and owner aims to revamp the historic venue to meet modern sports standards.

According to architect Maxwell Espina, who is overseeing both projects, they are currently in the bidding process for the Cebu Coliseum renovation.

Go assured that the iconic Cebu Coliseum signage will be preserved and that no tenants will be displaced due to the renovation. (KOC)

just want some opinions on this lol, i just want the degree and nothing else",13,0.88,27.0,1716801422.0,2024-05-27 17:17:02,rreqyu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cebu/comments/1d1nhk7/international_student_living_on_300_a_month_in/,https://reddit.com/r/Cebu/comments/1d1nhk7/international_student_living_on_300_a_month_in/,university of san carlos,True,3,7,6,0,16,"['bisaya', 'tagalog', 'conyo']",4,16,post,0.28727272727272724,0.46343750000000006,positive,1,0,,,

1cp56gv,Cebu,How was your Gabii sa Kabilin 2024 Beloved Bisaya experience?,"First time nako musuway gabii, ug usa ra gyud ka route akong nahuman - ang Route 1: Fort San Pedro, Casa Gorordo, University of San Carlos (USC) Museum, Cebu Normal University (CNU) Museum, Rizal Memorial Library and Museum. 6 routes man ata tanan.

Overall, nindot ra baya, pero kuwang ra gyud kaayo ang 6 hours kung ganahan ka mu-visit sa tanan lugar. Kada place imong ma-visit, tatakan (with picture sa location) nila imong ticket. Nasulit ra ang Php 300 kay mura rag igo gi-plete sa airconditioned buses ug sa mga museums. Kalas lang gyud oras maghuwat for the next bus. Anyway, I'm planning to try again next  year.

Ang Fort San Pedro, gi-skip nako kay kadaghan na ko naka-adto sauna.

Ang Casa Gorordo, bati ibisita sa gabii, kay dili kaayo hayag ang mga suga. Naa pud parts wa kaayo suga. Dili kaayo nimo ma-appreciate ang mga items on display.

Ang USC, daghan2x sad interesting items, especially sa religious artifacts. Ang earthenware part, medyo boring ra for me. Mas daghan ang display sa National Museum of the Philippines - Cebu, though wa ni labot sa akong route karon. Naka-visit ra ko before. Ang Ifugao section, so-so ra. Ang katong animals section, OK ra sab. Hastang daku-a man diay sa stuffed Philippine Eagle. Mas dako pas akong nawng. Naa pud toy squirrel on display. Nakapanguntana ko, ""Naa ba gud diy squirrel sa Cebu?"". Haha.

Ang CNU, dili puwede mag-picture2x, pero naa sad mga very old World War items gi-display. Medyo kuyaw lang ang floor kay naay uban parts mu-uyog, labi na kung kusog kaayo ang imong pagtamak. Murag ilisanan gyud ilang salog. I would have loved to spend more time here, especially mag-basa2x sa mga war-related writeups, pero decided to move fast, kay daghan waiting sa gawas.

Ang Rizal Memorial Library and Museum, wala kaayo items in display, more on sa theme sya sa event - ang Beloved Bisaya. Naay mga mga tarp gipapilit about Ignacio Alcina, ang pari nga nagsuwat ug libro about Visayas. Also, TIL from one of the tarps:

>the Bisaya means ""a happy man"" or ""a man of fine and pleasant disposition"" which is derived from its root word aya, saya, or caya, all pertaining to a ""person of fine disposition"" or ""a pleasant and happy person"".

Sa next floor, medyo boring. Naay mga display on Sinulog pictures, mostly kinuha sa mga photographers during Sinulog. Sa lower floor, naay mga artists didto nag-sketch sa mga dagway sa mga tao. Ang Cebu City Library, puwede ra pud masudlan, pero wa man kaayo ko nakita interesting didto, or needs more time para mag-tuyok2x.","how was your gabii sa kabilin 2024 beloved bisaya experience? first time nako musuway gabii, ug usa ra gyud ka route akong nahuman - ang route 1: fort san pedro, casa gorordo, university of san carlos (usc) museum, cebu normal university (cnu) museum, rizal memorial library and museum. 6 routes man ata tanan.

1l3t61q,Cebu,Is UP Cebu worth it?,"Incoming freshman here and I wonder what do locals think of this university. Most of the time, universities such as USC and CIT are recommended and there are lesser mentions of UPC.  Another factor I'm considering is employability because most of them said that UPC isn't that aligned to the industry compared to others, especially USC so I concluded that could be it.

1lhdmzi,Cebu,Current Best Food Places In Cebu,"Hi mga Ka-Sugbuanon!

My bestfriend, a home-grown Cebuana who became a German Citizen since 2017 is returning to PH / Cebu for a visit this July and I promised her that I’ll take her to all the best food spots here now. Europe has its own great dishes but gimingaw na jud sya ug authentic/real tasty pinoy meals. We were foodies together since Elem days until she migrated. Problem is, recently, I’ve become more of a lutong-bahay person coz I love cooking and I am not so updated with who’s who in Cebu’s food landscape.

Can I get your shortlist of recommended best restos/cafe/kan-anan around the Metro based on the following type of dishes?


Seafood/Seafood Boil:

Grilled / BBQ Spots: 

Chicken Inasal: Nanay Aida’s (Banilad/near USC)

Korean: Pearl Meatshop

Samgyupsal: Pearl Meatshop (AS Fortuna)

Japanese: Yushoken/Nonki/Wakamatsu

Cafe / Coffee:

Pastry:

Dimsum: Eat Fresh

Filipino:

Buffet Style:


Would greatly appreciate your recomms!
Thank you!

***Updated: I added dimsum coz that’s her fave and I included my own local faves that I tried.","current best food places in cebu hi mga ka-sugbuanon!

Akong ma hinomdoman late 2010s was kinda stale compared to the early 2010s (the best) ug mid-2010s (lukewarm). Lahi ra jud na era.

Mao ni akong ma hinomdoman

* Fidget Spinners
* Nostalgia memes based on 2009 hit songs such as ""Shooting Stars"" by Bag Raiders and ""Fireflies"" by Owl City in 2017.
* The Floor is Lava na meme. Mga Gen Z ato na time cge acting ato na meme sa mga bars ug nightclubs once ma hubog na.
* Everwing game sa Messenger
* First full year of a Duterte presidency, peak of the Drug War, news of the Bohol clashes, Battle of Marawi, APEC being hosted in the Philippines, Trump visiting the Philippines and a very polarized Filipino society
* Battle Royale games like PUBG/PUBG Mobile, Fortnite, Rules of Survival (ROS), and Call of Duty: Mobile.
* Mayor Osmena banned Sinulog street parties from 2017-2019, mao na dili to kiat na time. Ni balik lng pag 2020 onwards under Rama.
* Decline of EDM due to lack of spaces to hold such events and music festivals shifting to acoustic blues, hip hop, and mumble rap. For example, walay Life Dance pag 2019 kay walay space to hold out. Naa gihapon to Life Dance in 2018 ug Plus 63 in 2018 and 2019 pero na notice nako murag wala na kaayo na hype mga tao ug EDM. By 2020, Plus 63 shifted to acoustic bands from its previous EDM premise.
* For Linkin Park fans, the news namatay si Chester Bennington pag July 2017. Karon ra sila ni balik in 2024. Just proves that 2017 was a shitty year.
* Despacito na trending ato na time pag mid-2017.
* Boom of Samgyeopsal restaurants from 2018 onwards.
* 2018 would mark the time the pioneering senior high batch would graduate and become college students by AY 2018-2019. Since there was a ""culture war"" between college students and senior high students, mao na naa to ang ""Potential"" na meme in 2017 ug ang USC Wave. Gi recreate bitaw ang USC Wave pag 2023.
* 2019 was probably the only good year sa late 2010s based sa mga feedback na receive nako sa mga tao. Dili nako ma kalimtan ang good times sa 2019 na cgeg adventure, karaoke, Sugbo Mercado, hanging out with friends sa condo sa akong amigo sa Avida. All ended in March 2020 due to the pandemic.
* On a personal level, 2017-2018 was shitty because I suffered depression due to being pressured to take medicine and na suya ko sa akong mga colleagues na wala nag medicine and we're working (especially those nag Manila after graduation or board exam) and breathing sighs of relief na more academic stuff. Ni stop ko after one year, took masters, but ended becoming a second course on itself due to the pandemic. Somehow bounced back in 2019, only for it to be taken away again by the pandemic. Irony from what I learned while many of my colleagues or duol sa age nako namalhin ug Manila at this time, by the early 2020s ang mga Manila/South Luzon/North Luzon namalhimn diri sa Cebu kay mas less stressful.

Unsa man sad inyung memories ani na era?

* boom of samgyeopsal restaurants from 2018 onwards.
* 2018 would mark the time the pioneering senior high batch would graduate and become college students by ay 2018-2019. since there was a ""culture war"" between college students and senior high students, mao na naa to ang ""potential"" na meme in 2017 ug ang usc wave. gi recreate bitaw ang usc wave pag 2023.
* 2019 was probably the only good year sa late 2010s based sa mga feedback na receive nako sa mga tao. dili nako ma kalimtan ang good times sa 2019 na cgeg adventure, karaoke, sugbo mercado, hanging out with friends sa condo sa akong amigo sa avida. all ended in march 2020 due to the pandemic.
* on a personal level, 2017-2018 was shitty because i suffered depression due to being pressured to take medicine and na suya ko sa akong mga colleagues na wala nag medicine and we're working (especially those nag manila after graduation or board exam) and breathing sighs of relief na more academic stuff. ni stop ko after one year, took masters, but ended becoming a second course on itself due to the pandemic. somehow bounced back in 2019, only for it to be taken away again by the pandemic. irony from what i learned while many of my colleagues or duol sa age nako namalhin ug manila at this time, by the early 2020s ang mga manila/south luzon/north luzon namalhimn diri sa cebu kay mas less stressful.

unsa man sad inyung memories ani na era?

1j4x8qr,Cebu,college rlyy far from home,"helo! i am frm luzon but not from MM. for college, my main goal is to study elsewhere pero i think manila is too scary for me. i am considering USC-TC as an option.

my parents r against it bc of the distance and unfamiliarity. I’ve only been to cebu once, we dont have relatives in cebu but i have a lot of friends my age, my boyfrend, and his family. other than my connections there, research on USC has really gotten me sold on the school esp with their student centered activities and rankings also its price is pretty good relative to the big unis in manila.

i’ve also grown to like the metro + provincial environment cebu has got going on. im from a province n i’d say our place is only starting to develop palang, unlike cebu which has big malls, commercial areas, and is much like manila but with less pollution and a little less dense. i rlyy like this aspect of living in cebu! paired with its proximity to landmark destinations, truly has me sold.

i’d like to know if there are any students here who are studying in cebu na from other places din? i’m quite scared of the idea of living on my own in a foreign place but i refuse to show it to my parents bc i know it won’t help my case. i’d like to know more info to help put me at ease sana— ie living alone, environment, safety, newness of it all. input about talamban as a living place for a freshie would be rly helpful too!

1fywhoh,Cebu,What are your horror booth moments?,"Since October naman, it's spooky season once more.

Unsay inyung ma himodoman sa mga horror booth if naka suway mo? Be it a local barangay horror booth, ang iconic Horror Booth sa Mandaue (2007-2012; 2014), Horror Booth sa Parkmall (2008-2019; walay sila nag horror booth pag 2020-2023; ni balik lng pag 2024) sa peryahan, or sa school family day/foundation day?

Mine was from

* 2009-2011 - Family Day sa among school unya effort pa kaayo to mga horror booth ato na time. Kaduha gud mi mo balik kay makalingaw ang hadlok.
* 2011 - First time naka suway ko sa Horror Booth sa Mandaue. Mao to sauna i advertise as one of the best horror booths kay mao raman sad mag ingana diri sa Cebu every Halloween. We were supposed to try it in 2010 pero by the time we even knew naay horror booth (sauna dili pa paspas pag dissiminate sa social media; sa TV Patrol Visayas ra mi kibaw naa diay). But it was all too late kay taas kaayo ang linya. Gabie nami naka adto.
* 2012 - Katong naay horror booth sa Parkmall ug katong Outbreak Cebu Zombie Fun Run (based on Outbreak Manila in the early 2010s) na teaser na zombie maze. Unfortunately, wala to na dayon ang Outbreak Cebu Zombie Fun Run. It was originally scheduled for February 2013. Cebu would have its first zombie-themed Fun Run in October 2014 sa katong HyperCebu and also in April 2016 katong Run For Your Life sa USC-TC.
* 2013 - Among batch nag dala sa horror booth. Imbis common maze, among gi add ug challenge na they have to find an item within 5 minutes to be considered a winner.
* 2014 - Coinciding sa Parkmall ug Hypercebu, na nulod mi while waiting for the EDM rave.
* 2015 - Went with my classmates sa horror booth sa Parkmall.
* 2018 - House 104 didto dapit sa McDo and Casino Espanol. TBH, that spooky looking house turned into a horror booth was a good idea. I think mao ni ni pinaka last ni sulod ko kay karon dili naman hadlok. Probably just my age showing.

1f828e5,Cebu,"What was Cebu lifestyle, society, politics, and pop-culture during the mid-2010s (2015-2016)?","Tig browse ko sa r/decadeology ug r/nostalgia about trends in pop-culture and what not and it reminds me of the changing times na subject to constant change. I used to have a good memory pero as 2015 will become 10 years next year, my good memory isn't as good as it was before.

Ni previously ko post diri about Cebu lifestyle and pop-culture for early 2010s (2010-2014) and I got a lot of good answers.

Figured na I would do for mid-2010s and late 2010s (tomorrow).

Third year-fourth year College ko pag mid-2010s (2015-2016) and from what I remember:

* Dance pop/electropop/recession pop was replaced by chill pop and folk pop such as the likes of Ed Sheeran who became famous at this era. Timing kay diri ni sikat ang streaming platforms like Spotify and Soundcloud which mainly replaced iTunes and radio.
* Peak EDM years. Even though ni hinay na ang dance pop, EDM was the main party music. We still had Life Dance and Paintensity crossing over from the early 2010s. HyperCebu also was the biggest local Cebuano art and music fest before Plus 63 came, which was also focusing on EDM before switching to acoustic bands in 2020.
* Sinulog still had wild parties in Baseline pero nag ka decline tungod ang Baseline ani na time was converted to a condo that was still under construction. Also the time when people started questioning about the wild parties tungod sa mga hubog na KO sa dalan ug mga destruction of property nag occur in the area.
* Band gigs in Handuraw, Koa, and The Monastery. This is what I call peak mid-2010s.
* Clubs like Basic which at that time was criticized as full of kids. Basic closed down in 2019 but returned in 2023 pero didto sa Lapu-Lapu City. Naa sad to club sa Crossroads known as Dozo Izakaya pero its renamed to Red Foul? Correct me if I'm wrong.
* Pizza Republic made the headlines. Technically 2014 ni but mostly a mid-2010s phenomenon. I recently did a thread for this.
* Beginning of hidden gems like Funthastic Island, Hermit's Cove, Budlaan Falls, and Mount Kan-irag being known to the public due to the rise of social media. This brought the debate within adventure seekers about gatekeeping places to prevent hypes and flooding.
* Arrival of premium buffets. Actually started in 2014 with Tokyo Table (closed down in 2020). YakiMix in 2015 (pero karon one branch nalang sila, naa sa SM Seaside. Closed na ilang Escario branch since early 2024) and Vikings in 2016.
* Politics at home and abroad began a big shift. Rise of populism in the Western World, apil ta kay Duterte was rising in a wave of disgruntlement with the Liberal Party. SAF 44 was the last straw.
* Pope Francis visiting the Philippines was big news despite rumors na mo adto siya sa Cebu.
* International Eucharistic Congress a week after Sinulog 2016. Kani big news jud to.
* Running Man Challenge and Mannequin Challenge in 2016.
* Pokemon Go bisag kadiyot ra kaayo to. I'll never forget the times people would play it on the street, sa jeep, or even in Ayala which held a big event at that time.
* Vine, Dubsmash, [Musical.ly](http://Musical.ly), and Snapchat. Moa na na sikat to si Ato Ni Vines and ""Hala Nahulog"" na budots tungod atong naay hapit ni ambak sa Ayala.
* 9GAG memes, advise animals, and rage comics were replaced with Gen Z memes like the Arthur First, Spongegar, Oh Neptune, and r/polandball.
* Instagram new logo in 2016, followed by both IG and Facebook/Messenger adding 24 hr stories to copy Snapchat. Kani ang reason ni hinay ang Snapchat.
* Opening of new malls such as SM Seaside in November 27, 2015 and Robinson's Galleria on December 10, 2015.
* Return of Burger King to Cebu in November 2014.
* The SBE @ 80 flop at USC-TC Stadium.
* Movies like 50 Shades of Grey, Avengers: Age of Ultron, and Deadpool na grabe linya sa mga tao. Also the ending of The Hunger Games movie franchise with the final Mockingjay Part 2 in November 2015.
* Naay ni sunog sa heart sa SM pag Valentine's Day 2015.

1gfbmr0,Cebu,Horror Stories - Cebu Province edition,"I'll start 😅 🎃🐈‍⬛

USC North Campus - Minda Mura at the Auditorium, she was allegedly assaulted and killed near that area that's why she haunts it.

UP Cebu College Admin building - the building looks and feels old. The basement served as a garrison by the Japanese during the second World War where they tortured their victims.

- translate Western scientific knowledge to innovate Cebuano scientific culture;

>Sidenote: I know it was a crazy event pero maka mingaw jud ang 2012. Good vibes tanan, simple pa ang life, EDM and dance pop blended well, ug ang socio-cultural and socio-political landscape dili pa kaayo divided (i.e. politics wasn't as mainstream comapred to 2015-2024).

Mao ni akoa:

* PS3/Xbox 360 and PS4. Times na mag duwa ug Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 ug 3, Black Ops, BO2, Battlefield 3/4/Bad Company, ug GTA: V.
* Internet cafes like GOLS (closed in 2022), Pacific, and Voyager. Game City nalang ang buhi karon.
* BBQ Boss
* 9GAG memes, advice animal memes, and rage comics
* EDM (Avicii, David Guetta, Zedd, etc) and Dance pop (Ke$ha, Bruno Mars, Far East Movement, LMFAO, J-Lo, Rihanna, Jessie J, Pitbull, Chris Brown, Carly Rae Jepsen, Justin Bieber, One Direction, The Wanted, Jay Sean, Britney Spears, and Nicky Minaj, etc).
* EDM music fests like Life Dance, Paintensity, Sinulog Invasion, ug Summer Sunscream, bisag wala jud ko ka suway ug LD ug kausa rako naka Sinulog Invasion sa Baseline before ni close. The last Sinulog Invasion akong na try katong gi hold sa Fooda pag Sinulog 2016. Na inspired jud ni sa Project X movie.
* YouTube moments like machimina (closed in 2019), Mahalo Video Games, Roster Teeth, Smosh, Ray William Johnson, ug si pewdiepie.
* Yellow submarine sa Cebu - wala sad ko ka suway ani pero naay ni post sa Memories of Old Cebu, maka bring back lng ug memories of 2012-2013. Wala ni nag dugay kay naka banga ug coral.
* As a Carolinian: Better USC Days opening and closing concert/student party event.
* Kaduagan sa Mactan na i hold sa beach sa Mactan Shrine instead of the stage ug katong Rampada gi hold sa whole road from new bridge to old bridge.
* Ang Instagram pang shitpost pa. Uso pa jud ang filters ato, hashtag abuse, ug ang videos was introduced in 2013 pero 15-second clips only.
* Facebook timeline. I'm one of the few na ganahan sa layout na murag ""tree"".
* Kakao Talk ug Kik.
* Vines in 2013.
* Traffic in the early 2010s dili pa kaayo intense especially inig lunch time. Karon everyday na.
* The fact hadlok tanan tao mo end ang world inig May 21/October 21, 2011 ug December 21, 2012 tungod sa Apocalypse hypes. Mag katawa nalang ta looking back na perteng hadloka nato tanan pero cgeg gihapon paminaw ug ""2012 - It Ain't The End"" by Jay Sean ug ""Till The World Ends"" by Britney Spears.
* Despite how horrible the Bohol earthquake and Typhoon Haiyan was, it did bring Filipinos and the international community together. Mao na maka ingon ko the Typhoon Haiyan relief and recovery - despite the corruption involved - was the closest time in modern history that brought the world together. Previous ones happened during the end of WWII, the fall of communism, 9/11, Boxing Day Tsunami sa Indonesia, Hurricane Katrina, Haiti earthquake, and the Japan earthquake and tsunami.","what do you miss in the early 2010s (2010-2014) era? **(reposting kay the mods removed the previous post due to embedded links. wala kibaw bawal diay na. sayang sad kaayo kay this seems to be a good thread. not letting it go to waste. more context on the comments).**

>sidenote: i know it was a crazy event pero maka mingaw jud ang 2012. good vibes tanan, simple pa ang life, edm and dance pop blended well, ug ang socio-cultural and socio-political landscape dili pa kaayo divided (i.e. politics wasn't as mainstream comapred to 2015-2024).

mao ni akoa:

* ps3/xbox 360 and ps4. times na mag duwa ug call of duty: modern warfare 2 ug 3, black ops, bo2, battlefield 3/4/bad company, ug gta: v.
* internet cafes like gols (closed in 2022), pacific, and voyager. game city nalang ang buhi karon.
* bbq boss
* 9gag memes, advice animal memes, and rage comics
* edm (avicii, david guetta, zedd, etc) and dance pop (ke$ha, bruno mars, far east movement, lmfao, j-lo, rihanna, jessie j, pitbull, chris brown, carly rae jepsen, justin bieber, one direction, the wanted, jay sean, britney spears, and nicky minaj, etc).
* edm music fests like life dance, paintensity, sinulog invasion, ug summer sunscream, bisag wala jud ko ka suway ug ld ug kausa rako naka sinulog invasion sa baseline before ni close. the last sinulog invasion akong na try katong gi hold sa fooda pag sinulog 2016. na inspired jud ni sa project x movie.
* youtube moments like machimina (closed in 2019), mahalo video games, roster teeth, smosh, ray william johnson, ug si pewdiepie.
* yellow submarine sa cebu - wala sad ko ka suway ani pero naay ni post sa memories of old cebu, maka bring back lng ug memories of 2012-2013. wala ni nag dugay kay naka banga ug coral.
* as a carolinian: better usc days opening and closing concert/student party event.
* kaduagan sa mactan na i hold sa beach sa mactan shrine instead of the stage ug katong rampada gi hold sa whole road from new bridge to old bridge.
* ang instagram pang shitpost pa. uso pa jud ang filters ato, hashtag abuse, ug ang videos was introduced in 2013 pero 15-second clips only.
* facebook timeline. i'm one of the few na ganahan sa layout na murag ""tree"".
* kakao talk ug kik.
* vines in 2013.
* traffic in the early 2010s dili pa kaayo intense especially inig lunch time. karon everyday na.
* the fact hadlok tanan tao mo end ang world inig may 21/october 21, 2011 ug december 21, 2012 tungod sa apocalypse hypes. mag katawa nalang ta looking back na perteng hadloka nato tanan pero cgeg gihapon paminaw ug ""2012 - it ain't the end"" by jay sean ug ""till the world ends"" by britney spears.
* despite how horrible the bohol earthquake and typhoon haiyan was, it did bring filipinos and the international community together. mao na maka ingon ko the typhoon haiyan relief and recovery - despite the corruption involved - was the closest time in modern history that brought the world together. previous ones happened during the end of wwii, the fall of communism, 9/11, boxing day tsunami sa indonesia, hurricane katrina, haiti earthquake, and the japan earthquake and tsunami.",47,0.87,131.0,1707536476.0,2024-02-10 11:41:16,Craft_Assassin,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cebu/comments/1an715c/what_do_you_miss_in_the_early_2010s_20102014_era/,https://reddit.com/r/Cebu/comments/1an715c/what_do_you_miss_in_the_early_2010s_20102014_era/,usc cebu,True,15,21,10,1,46,"['bisaya', 'tagalog', 'conyo']",5,47,post,-0.019876395534290277,0.42070232399179763,neutral,1,1,,,

I grew up in Cebu. Baby to teenager. But for some weird reason, it was acceptable for us (in our time, mid-late 2000s) to be drinking even at 12 years old. It's not that parents weren't strict - but the culture during my time was that there were SO many available places to drink, outside of parental guidance. We could get into clubs and were served drinks in billiard bars. Even in the province, it was ""okay"" for teenagers to drink, especially during fiestas and discos. We were from CIC, USC, STC etc but we were hard drinkers by the time we turned 13 or 14! We'd look forward to Sinulog or Bob Fests or whatever event and party. Weekly ang partying at the time! And guys our age from USC, Sacred Heart, DB etc were also in the same clubs and bars and drinking.

pzqdrf,Cebu,Cebu Horror Stories for October 2021,"In the spirit of Halloween, now is the month to share horror stories.

I'll start with mine.

\---

I don't really believe in the paranormal and yes nothing paranormal happened to me per se. What I will narrate though is what was the general consensus of the retreat of the USC Biology, Chemistry, and Physics department back then on September 2-3, 2016. We were told to avoid this room at the end of the hallway. People call it the ""evil room"" and we heard stories of such as handprints on the window or knocks at night. Some people also report apparitions of white lady in the said room.

So when we arrived on the retreat house, all of us were outside the evil room and we even tried to turn the doorknob. To our dismay, it was locked. Someone said that it was lock to contain what evil or entity was inside. My other friend (who is into airsoft and tactical stuff) joked about breaching the door Navy SEAL or SWAT style. We just laughed.

Nothing at all happened the entire retreat. We had a tearful activity that night and even took our group picture in the stairs. Then when we given siesta time, the girls were taking pictures in the view that gave the city lights below while the boys and I were having a *Kitchen Nightmares* marathon. Even during the lights out time, I was assigned as the hallway patrol to make sure everyone was inside their rooms. It was somehow dark save for the green emergency exit light and I didn't feel anything spooky at all. I was one of the last to sleep as I was talking to some friends who just stayed outside the room kanang chika2 lng well past into midnight. While we were doing this, we could see the security guard below doing roving near the forest. The only sign of his pressence was the illumination of his flashlight.

When morning came, we finished the retreat activities and were dismissed. Without anything spooky.

I would later learn two years later na timing sa among retreat, [mao ta na time na ang School of Business and Economics nag suway ug form ug ""SBE @ 80"" sa stadium sa ubos pero pirting pagka palpak](https://www.reddit.com/r/Carolinian/comments/pfp2v5/throwback_five_years_ago_today_was_the_sbe_80/). Kami nag retreat mi ato so we were spared sa chaos nag unfold below kay wala daw clear plano ang mga organizers. Wala ko na aware ani until 2018 when kita ko sa akoang mga SBE friends nag share2 ug mga throwback. LOL

As the researchers are distributing the incentives manually, please note that there may be some delays with the distribution of the 20 pesos.

There may be instances where the 20 pesos will be sent in groups, so please check your Gcash notifications, as they may not alert you through text message. Lastly, we'd greatly appreciate if you could share this survey to other friends and family members who fit the criteria.

I immediately found this terrifying because one of these batchmates (let's call her ERA) is one of the people that may be responsible of spreading rumors of me na meron ako BO (I was never cared for by my mom about my hygiene; back then I was labelled na unhygienic and the rumor resurfaced back around my start sa shs). This made me entirely insecure throughout my SHS days  led me to overconsumption of buying so much products just to help release the sweat and odor sa humid na Cebu.

Even tho ERA was at USC sa shs... she did visit my old school before to reunite with friends (this was usually around the first + second week of school as well as events like Intrams). ERA is well loved and a social butterfly pero to me... bad vibes all over kase. knowing that these potential batchmates can be connected to her, as well as a slight possibility na they will be in the same campus as me... im emotionally doomed and felt so much shame for my image before they will get a chance to meet me someday. I can't help it... I only genuinely want to get away from the horrors sa mga false rumors made by me... Please lang 😭 my self esteem is bad already I cannot handle more sa college.

o6z1qa,studentsph,(USC Cebu) Advertising Arts Questions,"Hello po! I am a G12 graduate who is about to enroll to college. I live in Mindanao, and initially, I would want to pursue a course that tackles more on art and design most especially in digital arts, to which na stumble ko yung Advertising Arts. Although there isn't a sufficient course in digital arts dito, me and my parents agreed to try univrtsities outside of Mindanao, and picked the closest one in Cebu.

USC offers Advertising Arts, and I was pretty much pumped for this course, since I love creating digital drawings, illustrations and such in a large scale. Pero there's this thought in my head that keeps popping up when I first saw the curriculum and courses offered. I was reluctant as ""Advertising,"" is certainly ambiguous, since I thought, at first, that Advertising Arts will only tackle on digital arts and not on any other media (i.e. Photography, Poster Campaigns etc). Even though I would want to have a career at least remotely related to Character Design, Illustration, Concept Art etc; will this course suffice in helping me learn the skills I need in order to reach that kind of career? 

Sorry if I'm a bit poetic, haha, pero I'm really having trouble wrapping around the art course I want; since my choices are very limited, I believe Advertising Arts is the closest thing I can enroll with. But I keep panicking about the ""thesis"" thing in the course, as I have only read about something about campaign posters and advertisements and such, is there, like, a choice to pursue something like an animation, story or whatever in the ""thesis?"" (I'm not really knowledgeable about how it works)

Another thing I question is if Multimedia Arts better for me than Advertising?

I have so many questions, but I'll stop here for now.

tigfg1,phcareers,Double Degree Programs,"I just want to share these for people who are contemplating on pursuing a dual degree, either bachelor's or graduate degrees. I always believe that people should be ""jack of all trades, master of none"". I know it's not applicable in some degrees or other professions, not needed by everyone (costly) and can be quite hard, but with this ever-changing and competitive world, we should need to have a multifaceted approach on some fields. Of course, we can just pursue certificate programs, self study or online trainings (free) if we want to. :)

I am a teacher (F27) and he (ex) was an Instructor (M27)  in a well-known university here at Pangasinan. We were batchmates during our college years and became an official couple after we graduated in the year 2017. After graduation, we applied in different private schools and fortunately that same year, we were hired. I taught in San Carlos City while he taught in Urdaneta City. During the early years of our relationship, we were really happy. He was an amazing boyfriend, the sweetest and also the ideal one. We both decided to pursue our master's degree (2019)and luckily we were able to graduate in the year 2022. Our batchmates, parents, friends and us, also hoped that in the end we'll become a married couple. But unfortunately, our almost six-year relationship ended last November 2022.

11uspwq,Philippines,MNP Request from GOMO to GLOBE,"Hello,

Ask ko lang sa inyo, nakapag request na kasi ako ng sim switch kay Globe.

Nabigyan na ako ni GOMO ng USC and naibigay ko na kay Globe. Currently, wala pa naman 48 hrs yung request ko. Under review parin siya ni Globe. Pero ask ko lang, once approved ba ito, kahit wala pa yung sim sa akin na idedeliver, mawawalan na ako ng signal kay GOMO?

Let say may signal parin ako kay GOMO pero I decided not to activate the sim na nadeliver na sa akin,  talaga bang mawawalan parin ako ng signal kalaunan?

Parang nagsisi ako na iprocess si MNP since wala palang magandang promo si Globe sa internet eh. HAHAHA. Though habol ko rin kasi na makatawag sa landline using the number na pinapa-port ko na hindi ko kasi magawa kay GOMO sa mga bank. Lately ko na rin kasi nalaman na negative si GOMO sa landline calls. 

Balak ko kasi ipostpaid na rin sana ito kaso may existing postpaid na kasi ako kay SMART Enterprise eh.

1j5hv9d,Philippines,"Globe Customer Service, bow","Sobrang walang kwenta ng Globe Customer Service. I wanted to port out my number sa Smart, napakahaba ng pinagdaanan at ilang araw ko sinubukan iaccomplish, na kaya naman magawa kahit wala pa 30 minutes.

Unang una, ginawa nilang ""online"" lahat. 211 na hotline ididivert ka sa GlobeOne app na ididivert ka sa Messenger ChatBot na wala naman kayang gawin. Basically, sa haba haba ng pasa pasa di rin pala kaya. Pwede pa kuno itext na lang USC to 5050 para makuha ang USC needed for mobile number porting. Pero pag text mo, papapuntahin ka rin sa physical store.

Pangalawa, napaka walang kwenta rin ng physical store service. 3 beses ako pabalik balik dahil I gave up kaiiintay na 1 oras bawat intay na walang kinahinatnan. 1st try, may QR queue, 1 oras. Wala pa rin. Decided to leave. 2nd try, may QR queue pa rin na nakapaskil. Nagintay ako, yun pala may physical number na kukunin sa guard na non-existent at nakababad sa cellphone at walang paki sa customers, kailangan mo tanungin kung ano gagawin mo pag ganito ganyan para malaman mo na kukuha ka pala ng number. Edi pota, wala pala akong iniintay. 3rd try, wala na yung QR queue na nakapaskil. Kumuha na ako agad ng number. Number 1. Nagiintay ako nang may dumating na na bagong customer, number 5. Nauna pa siya. Nagtanong na ako, ano bang iintay ko sa number ko, kararating lang ng number 5 nauna pa. Depende daw sa transaction, tapos tinawag na rin ako. Malamang to pacify me, aba dapat lang. Pag sabi ko na need ko USC, wala pang 2 minutes tapos na kailangan ko sa Globe. 3 tries sa physical store, 1 hour each. Kaya pala in less than 2 minutes. 7 ang tao sa globe = 1 guard na nasa cellphone, 1 sa cashier, 1 sa kung ano pang counter yun, 3 sa after sales na ewan ko kung magtatrabaho lang pag trip na nila. 

Pagdating ko sa Smart, 1 guard, tinanong transaction, binigyan ng number. Pagkaflash sa screen. Sinabi transaction, process. Tapos. 1 guard, 4 customer representative. Mas efficient. 

Sayang oras ng buhay ko sa Globe, Tangina niyo.

gdxjqk,Philippines,ABS-CBN Shutdown Megathread,"&#x200B;

thank you /u/starscar12!

**TL:DR/DW: Reason of the shutdown was due to expiration of the franchise, and the issue of congress to deny a renewal which they (ABS-CBN) have previously attempted to renew in multiple occasions (as far back as 2016). Hence the action taken by the NTC for ABS-CBN to shutdown, as their contract ended on Monday. May 05 2020.**

**News spread out quickly as 11,000 people at ABS-CBN were jobless by the shutdown. And with the Political climate of the Philippines + the on going battle of ABS vs Dueterte this quickly garnered national headlines and discussions for and against the shutdown.**

**LAHAT TO SA GITNA NG EPIDEMYA.** **^(GOD BLESS THE PHILIPPINES./S)**

***take this tl:dr with a grain of salt as no one truly knows what is happening with this gov't and its agenda.***

&#x200B;","abs-cbn shutdown megathread &#x200b;

thank you /u/starscar12!

**tl:dr/dw: reason of the shutdown was due to expiration of the franchise, and the issue of congress to deny a renewal which they (abs-cbn) have previously attempted to renew in multiple occasions (as far back as 2016). hence the action taken by the ntc for abs-cbn to shutdown, as their contract ended on monday. may 05 2020.**

**news spread out quickly as 11,000 people at abs-cbn were jobless by the shutdown. and with the political climate of the philippines + the on going battle of abs vs dueterte this quickly garnered national headlines and discussions for and against the shutdown.**

**lahat to sa gitna ng epidemya.** **^(god bless the philippines./s)**

***take this tl:dr with a grain of salt as no one truly knows what is happening with this gov't and its agenda.***

***i  want to note that you please link your source for your argument or claim. we already have enough fake news as it is. salamat*** /r/ph

*at unahan ko na mga troll or users who feel that this post is against the admin or whatever, this shutdown is more than just technicalities over tax evasion, commercial ad's or whatever, this marks a day where thousands of people have lost their jobs and press freedom is slowly getting revoked by the current admin. and with the talk of martial law lately, this is a crucial period where in discussion of  factual information and freedom of speech is needed. if you feel this is unimportant feel free to downvote and move on, but i hope you do feel the importance of this current event. we are here to discuss and not fight remember that.*

zjp9j3,Philippines,From GOMO to another network,"Hi, it looks like walang guide ang GOMO PH on how to switch network from them to another, puro ang guide na nakikita ko ay pa port sa kanila.

Contacted them already about my concern and waiting for their response, will share the info here once makakuha ako ng feedback, but for now if anyone here na na try na mag move away from them?

UPDATE: Nag response na yung support nila (Facebook) and very accommodating naman sila. They asked me the reason why gusto ko mag port out and told them my reason.

1k3p4rm,Cebu,13 years since the best last-day-of-school concert night party sa among alma matter,"SKL aning memory.

Kausa ra jud among high school alma matter nag student's night na event and that was 13 years ago. Unlike other schools na every year mag student's night, kato ra sad jud na time ni hitabo and never again. Lingaw to na night kay kami mga teens (I myself was third year high school) naka suway what it's like ba kanang maka apil ug dance party with good music and the lights.

It was for the 20th anniversary sa among school. Yes katawanan kay 20th on 4/20 lol. Lively kaayo to kay ang mga songs of the era mga upbeat party pop songs (i.e. Black Eyed Peas, The Wanted, One Direction, Jessie J, Rihanna, etc.) na gi acoustic cover sa mga student performers. However, since last day of school sad to, gi punan jud ug emotional songs para naay hilakay sa ending such as ""Thousand Years"" ni Christina Perri and ""Someone Like You"" by Adele. Then ang final act is nanganta tanan school staff and student performers ug ""Together"" from High School Musical followed by a grand fireworks display na mo symbolize sa end of the school year and the beginning of Summer 2012. Usa sad to sa iconic summers ang 2012 tungod sa vibes, ang gaming, pop-culture, and na release ang The Avengers.

This was in 2012 and panahon ni when crowded parties with all the music, confetti, and the lights was the norm tungod sa bago lng ang Sinulog Invasion ug Project X na movie. I know dili jud ka compare ang among student's night na concert party to those makita nato sa Sinulog Invasion, mga street parties sa Sinulog, mga college parties, Life Dance, Summer Sunscream, etc., pero for us mga students na underage pa ana time, **kato na student's night was already a treat**. Samot na dili pa mi kasulod ug bar ug bago pasad to ang Sinulog Invasion ato na time. Ang naka sulod ra ug bar, LifeDance,or katong mang laag ug Baseline pag Sinulog were those na taas ug mature ug itsura or naay connections sa mga organizers.

Para namo high school students, it was the best of its time kay kausa ra jud to nihitabo. Just like Sinulog, mao ra sad ang time ang mga boundaries ug ka awkward nawala as everyone became friends and family on that night. Murag one of the times lng na unite ang school regardless of age and year-level tungod sa libreng kalingawan ug music.

In retrospect, yes mas better ang mga college parties like Affinity welcome party and the Intrams concert sa USC ug Univercity Fest sa Spectrum pero that was a year later pa pag college na namo but wala pa man sad mi ka experience. Swerte lng jud naka timing kay wala na jud to balika na event. Even pag 25th anniversary sa among alma matter pag 2017 and 30th pag 2022.

Mao ra to guys. Just sharing this memory of simpler times.

P.S. Daghan nag comment ato na time ngano wala gi pa tukar ang ""Young, Wild, and Free"" bisan clean version kay 4/20 baya pero bisan ang clean version pa, dili na ""school friendly"" lol","13 years since the best last-day-of-school concert night party sa among alma matter skl aning memory.

x26hxv,phcareers,Can a Civil Engineer become rich? I am on the verge between life and death right now. Please guide me with my career decisions.,"So I am taking 1st year BS in Accountancy at the moment and I do not feel comfortable with it. Maybe because my peers came from ABM strand and I am from the STEM strand. I feel very left behind right now, I don't know if it's because of the school's (USC) learning system. I was that very consistent, focused, active, and with honors student back then, but I do not know any more now. I chose accountancy for practicality because it is a very flexible career where I can go to different industries and as far as I know it also gives a high salary. It can also give me the opportunity to go abroad. Are my feelings at the moment valid? Can I still catch up and do better in my current program? Now I am stuck in the dilemma of dropping from this degree program to shift to Civil Engineering because I believe I am confident in Engineering. I am good in all of the subjects in my STEM strand in SHS years. I am good in any science and math fields.

My father gave me permission to choose what I want. (I am so lucky to have him because, despite the hardships and sacrifices he is going through, he really wants to provide me with a better life in the future. Because he wasn't able to have it during his time because they were poor and because of him our life became better. That is why I really want to make sure of my career plans because I want to give him a very comfortable life. Bata palang siya nagtatrabaho na siya until now, kaya gusto kong bayaran lahat ng sacripisyong ginawa niya.)

I was contemplating choosing Civil Engineering as my career path because the supply of Civil Engineers is a lot, although I think if I can do better than most of them it will all be fine, and I heard that their entry-level salary is low. I think it is okay if it will only be low during the 1st to 3rd year. I am looking for a long-run situation in my career. I am also a female which is one reason why I am hesitant. But I heard that in other countries outside, there is no gender discrimination with entering the field. Can I eventually earn a high salary if I become a Civil Engineer and How?

I also thought of Nursing because it will give me a lot of opportunities abroad but I don't have any relatives abroad that can guide and help me. Will the process be hard? What is the process I must undertake to work abroad as a nurse and earn high? How much is the estimated money that I will spend? I was also quite inspired by the life of Florence Nightingale, we share a lot in common. From her values to her strengths, which are wanting to help heal people, not into marriage, and also good in math. I don't know if it correlates.

Is it better to earn high here in the Philippines or work abroad? Which country is better to migrate to and work in?

Would you rather suggest another Engineering career or another career that I haven't mentioned? Probably Marketing, Finance, Nursing, Medtech, Psychology, Dentistry, Industrial Engineering, Chemical Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Interior Design, Architecture, etc. I am mediocre in IT which is why I am not confident in this field.

I would like to ask for your insights regarding my problem. Your help could save a 19-year-old girl with huge dreams in life.

1ajzdv9,casualph,Prepaid sim card to postpaid but different provider,"Not sure if this is the right sub lol. 

May dalawa akong registered sim cards, isang TM and isang Globe postpaid. Ginagamit ko yung Globe as my personal number and ayoko sana siya gamitin for work. As may mobile allowance kami sa work and encouraged to have a work phone, ayoko sanang kumuha ng bagong sim card kaya naisip ko na yung TM ko nalang gagamitin ko for work purposes. 

That being said, pwede kaya ipa-papalit ko ng provider yung TM to Smart, retaining the number. Nung nagtanong kasi ako sa dalawang magkaibang branch ng Smart, nagkaiba sagot nila sakin. Yung una branch near my office in Laguna, bawal dapat postpaid to postpaid daw while yung pangalawa, sa MOA pa na napadaan lang ako, pwede basta hihingi ng USC sa globe.

Iniisip ko sana ipaprocess nalang sa MOA as dun sinabi pwede pero hassle bumyahe. Kaya I’m asking for a clarification dito.","prepaid sim card to postpaid but different provider not sure if this is the right sub lol.

156cc33,askph,Horrible MNP experience from GOMO to Globe: What should I do??,"Horrible MNP experience from GOMO to Globe: What should I do??

I ported from Globe to GOMO last 2022 just a few weeks when MNP is already in effect. And it was smooth naman. 

Even though ang ganda ng services ng GOMO, there are still some things na di ko magawa like reply “YES” to confirm my credit card transaction. So that made me want to switch back to Globe. 

Last Saturday, I made an MNP request to GOMO thru their FB messenger bot. And I received the USC agad. Although pwede naman magrequest online na magorder ng Globe sim, I decided to do it sa branch instead, I badly need it na kasi. 

Before processing my request, the staff told me that I still need to order the Globe sim online, but they will still provide me a new sim. After doing so, the staff processed my request. They asked for the USC and the Porting code, and they gave me my new sim. Nawalan na ng signal yung GOMO ko. After inserting the new globe sim on my phone, may signal na, pero pag tatawagan, “cannot be reached” pa sya. And di makareceive ng SMS. The staff told me to wait for 4 hours for it to be activated. So umuwi na ko, 4 hours has passed, and still wala pa rin. Unusable pa rin sya. (Lumalabas yung “Please wait. Your request is being processed” na message everytime irerestart ko yung phone) So I decided na magchat na sa Globe CS thru messenger. They told me to wait for 24-48 hours for it to be activated. 

Fast forward to 24-48 hours, wala pa rin, di pa rin magamit! Nagchat na naman ako sa Globe CS, told me that they forwarded it to their support group and gave me a reference number, and they told me to.. guess what?  Wait for 24-48 hours na naman! Araw araw ko finafollow up pero same lang nang same yung response nila. (Note that I also tried to contact them thru 211 pero puro automated messages lang ang narinig ko kahit anong i-dial ko)

Wednesday, may dumating na Globe sim sa bahay, ito siguro yung inorder online. Ininsert ko rin sa phone, pero same na same lang ang nangyayari. May signal pero unusable. 

Friday, I reached out to Globe kung ano na ang status ng request ko. They told me na expired na daw yung number ko kasi di ko daw niloadan for the last 60 days. Like WTF?? Wala pa ngang 6 days yung sim ko? Ang advice nila ay pumunta ako sa Globe store at bumili ng bagong sim. Nice one diba? After a few hours, nagtanong ulit ako sa Globe kung ano status, this time, nasa Support group pa rin daw. Grabe ang hirap sa globe makipag usap. 

Ang tanong ko, ano ang dapat kong gawin? May signal pa rin naman ako, pero di ko pa rin sya magamit until now. 1 week na ko di makagamit ng banking apps na need ng OTP. Malayo samin yung nearest Globe store kaya nanghihinayang ako baka masayang punta ko. Salamat po sa sasagot!","horrible mnp experience from gomo to globe: what should i do?? horrible mnp experience from gomo to globe: what should i do??

Lingaw jud, naa sad mi 4 ka lalaki gikan Engineering na mga siaw pud kaayo. 

Nya, pagka gabie ato, naka decide mi sa akong partner nga mag dinner sa Silogan ni Gian across USC TC.

t6efnj,Cebu,Best pre-law course under the DOST scholarship in Cebu unis?,"Hi! I'm currently a freshman in college. I originally enrolled in USJ-R under BS CPE, but then realized I didn't like it as much as I had anticipated. I shifted to BSN after realizing I didn't really know what I wanted yet, and that's what my mom begged me to take up. However, the day after I shifted to BSN, I found out that I was a DOST-SEI Scholarship qualifier, and the only courses in USJ-R main covered by the scholarship were BS Bio, BS Psych, BSIE, BSSE major in Math and another one majoring in Science (not so sure if the last two are also offered in usj-r main) I thought I wanted to be a doctor, and I do, so I decided to shift to BS Bio. Continued with BS Bio and ended up hating it so much. I could not care less about my majors and ended up getting low marks due to a combination of hating the major, adhd, depression, and another thing I can't disclose. Note that all of this happened in less than a month. 

Recently, I've been engaging and volunteering in campaign activities for VP Leni and I volunteered in a free medical and legal service mission here in my city. There, I felt a tug in me of wanting to know more about how this world works and the world in general. Then I realized how consistent my love for justice had always been, even as a child, and how much I've been vocal about how much I hated injustice and biases. Part of why I wanted to become a doctor was because I wanted to badly to be able to help less fortunate people have access to medical services. 

I want to become a lawyer. Idk how or if it's even possible for a neurodivergent person to become a good lawyer without much behavioral therapy, but I guess that's really gonna be up to me and how I deal with my problems.

1d1nbnz,Cebu,I feel hopeless and helpless.,"I am a (hopefully) graduating student in USC, studying BS-ICT since 2014, and one of my goals in life is to create websites and video games with the skills I learned and probably earn a living. However, due to complications with life, and of course the pandemic, I have been VERY VERY VERY delayed in my progress. And ever since 2021, I felt lost, I felt out of direction, I felt I want to go easy way out. 

But with the help of family, friends, and relatives, and a couple of life-changing events in my life: COVID, Odette, the passing of my lolo, I felt like I had to make my move; to make an effort. I returned to try and finish my requirements in order to graduate, started self-learning a new programming language and software engine, even tried learning a musical instrument and making music as a hobby and probably potential moneymaking venture, started exercising after my family and friends told me I was getting overweight, even helping my family with many things. I also even got a job, albeit on a seasonal contract, but still, a job nonetheless. 

It felt like I was making progress, but it was too damn slow. It wasn't enough. And it only got worse.

Recently I stumbled upon videos of how AI will take over jobs, how companies are overcharging you, how your favorite video games and studios are closing down, how the world feels like it's moving too fast, and so on and so forth.

And since I want to work with coding and programming involved, I fear I might lose my worth and my skills' worth. I feel like I can't find a solution. I felt like the world wanted me to fail eternally.

I feel hopeless and helpless, no matter how much i want to say otherwise. 

But above all, I feel afraid. I feel afraid that I could lose my purpose in life just because something is better than me. I feel afraid that I might fall into despair and purposelessness again. I feel afraid that I will be worthless to everyone around me.","i feel hopeless and helpless. i am a (hopefully) graduating student in usc, studying bs-ict since 2014, and one of my goals in life is to create websites and video games with the skills i learned and probably earn a living. however, due to complications with life, and of course the pandemic, i have been very very very delayed in my progress. and ever since 2021, i felt lost, i felt out of direction, i felt i want to go easy way out.

13rzny4,Cebu,How would Cebu look like right now if COVID-19 did not happen?,"What if the pandemic never occurred? Anything beyond March 15, 2020 would look so much different.

Akong ma huna2:

* Many closed businesses right now would still be open. Metrosports, katong obstacle course na gym sa Crossroads, Jerry's Chicken across USC-TC, ug BBQ Boss would not close. This means those who got laid off would have kept their jobs too.
* CCLEX would have been finished before March 2021, just in time for the 500th anniversary of Christianity reaching the Philippines.
* Cebu would have tried the ""Grandest of the Grand"" Sinulog festival which was supposed to be held in March of that year instead of January. It would have been the celebration of a lifetime. Rumors had it that the King of Spain and the Pope were supposed to bless the event.
* Perhaps ang Kadaugan sa Mactan for 2021 would have their own grand event as well.
* There would have been big progress sa construction sa SM Arena so by this alternate 2023, halfway there na mahuman. Construction was delayed due to lockdowns.
* NuStar would have probably opened earlier.
* Probably lots of concerts and ganaps that were scheduled to happen would have pushed through.
* What's more interesting is how no COVID would affect the 2022 elections. Tiktok and social media use increased during the pandemic. BBM's campaign focused on social media disinformation. Could it be possible the results would have been much different here?
* I'm also not sure how this would affect the inflation. Some say the inflation was already inevitable, but it was only worsened by the COVID recession and economic collapse.
* No tuob controversy, Sinas birthday party quarantine, and the UP anti-terror bill protests would have been larger with no arrests made for one thing.
* Baskins and Robins would have opened here along with the return of Subway.

On the personal note:

* I would have graduated in December 2020 instead of June 2022. Na delay ko sa thesis nako tungod sa lockdown. I couldn't use the lab man kay pag ECQ, students were not permitted to enter.
* Some acquaintances and family friends would still be alive today. Some of them succumbed to COVID-19 sadly. The same would be said for anyone who died due to this sickness.
* Our mountaineering club batch 2019-2020 would have had that despidida in Bantayan before going our separate ways. And speaking of reunions, maka reunion unta jud mi with my previous batch 2016-2017 kay all my former clubmates in that batch were having a nostalgic wave.

*I wanted to share something that’s been on my mind as I passed by USC after several years. Over time, I’ve grown to love and advocate for stray cats and dogs, but a particular memory from my college days in USC still weighs heavily on my conscience. Back then, as part of our zoology class requirement, each group of five students was required to submit one live cat. Tragically, these cats were euthanized as part of the class. I’ll never forget the day my group submitted a cat—our ""group cat""—who was pregnant at the time. As someone who has been advocating for strays for years now, I truly hope that USC finds alternative methods for teaching this class, ones that do not involve taking the lives of countless cats each school year. It breaks my heart to think of the loss and I sincerely wish for a more humane approach moving forward.*

1j4np8c,Cebu,Private School for Elementary with School Van/Carpool,"Hi everyone!

My child will be in Grade 1 next school year and I plan to transfer her to another private school because it's too expensive to keep her in the same school.  All school fees are more than 160k for Grade 1. It's an international school and it's the only one near us, like 1km away, a 10-minute walk. Soooooo, here are my needs:

1. Has a school van/carpool service - I can't commute because I work (1 full time and 1 part time, so I lack sleep and need to rest a bit while she's carpooling), we're in the Lahug area. I'd rather avoid habal-habal (motorcycle taxis) because what if it rains, or she has a lot of things to carry. It's about safety too.

2. I'm okay with a school fee range of 70k-80k

3. Preferably classes with less than 25 students

4. I don't mind if it's Montessori or traditional in terms of academics, as long as it's quality education

5. Co-ed, my child is a girl

I tried inquiring at USC Montessori Academy, Sacred Heart School - Hijas, and Philippine Christian Gospel School. But they don't offer a school van or carpool.

USC-SC, however, has a tie-up with a 3rd party carpool, but the child needs a companion.  It's 10k per month for two pax, they offered 8k if I share the ride with my child on my lap. In short, it's almost the same cost as her current school.

1le61yn,Philippines,Transport chief eyes busway system in España-Quezon Avenue route,"MANILA -- After seeing how crucial and helpful the EDSA Bus Carousel has become to commuters in Metro Manila, the Department of Transportation (DOTr) is now looking to replicate the busway system along España Boulevard in Metro Manila up to Quezon Avenue in Quezon City.

DOTr Secretary Vince Dizon said his agency is already working on a feasibility study for the project, which he hopes to complete by next year.

""To me, the most viable and the most needed one is España to Quezon Avenue. That’s wide enough for a busway… Estudyante yun, that’s UST (University of Santo Tomas), critical ‘yan,” he said, referring to the number of schools located along or near the route.

Just like the EDSA busway, Dizon believes government can be the one to run it initially.

“I think we’ll have to do it government muna, kamukha nung EDSA. We’ll do it like EDSA. We’ll use that model then we’ll privatize the O&M (Operations and Maintenance),” he added.

The DOTr plans to privatize the EDSA Bus Carousel as well, with the bidding war set for next year.

IFC (International Finance Corporation) is helping us to PPP (Public-Private Partnership) the busway and I think that’s the way forward. That’s the long-term solution to the EDSA busway,” he said.

But before then, the DOTr is working to rehabilitate the bus lane by adding more buses and improving the headway, as well as putting up covered bridgeways and elevators.

“We have roughly about P500 million, if I’m not mistaken. Plus we’re going to add the replacement to Mt. Kamuning. We’re going to do that first this year,” said Dizon.

Other bus rapid transit systems that the government is implementing are the ones in Cebu and Davao.

That’s a gamechanger also because that will be a model for other cities like Iloilo, Bacolod, Baguio, madaming pwedeng matutunan doon sa Davao. It’s very delayed. I think it’s two years delayed but we have to catch up,” added Dizon.

1eqcwff,Philippines,What are your insights regarding a possible Railway Renaissance in the future? (Starting with Luzon),"Summary of the post: ""From just three existing train lines in NCR, the DOTr hopes to usher in a railway renaissance by 2030 with the expected completion of new transport projects such as the Metro Manila Subway, the North-South Commuter Railway, and the MRT-7. #CommuterPatrol (📷: DOTr) | via Andrea Taguines, ABS-CBN News.

Just stumbled upon a recent post from the ABS CBN news site on FB and along came with this grand map of the existing, Non existing lines, soon to be existing lines.

And to be honest, despite the various unexpected delays to the construction of these lines....I did felt some excitement for the future and when DOTR expressed its goal of ushering a Railway Renaissance (At least in Luzon for the time being) It kind of reminded me of the time when the country had various railway lines throughout the archipelago and that was during the Pre War Years (Unfortunately, most of these railway lines were destroyed during the war).

With Luzon having an extensive railway line which stretches from the upper region (Dagupan, La Union etc.) to Southern Region (Bicol Area etc.)

This quote from P. Alcazaren also caught my attention.

""Before the war, we had three types of railways: you had the tranvia—the very light rail—and you had the inter-area rail, the one that went from McKinley to Tutuban Station, and then you had the trains that went up to Dagupan and eventually San Fernando, La Union [and] as far south as Bicol.""

The way he described it as if it was a grand.

And it was unfortunate that after the war, the railway lines were never the same.

Cebu had its own Railway system but also got destroyed during the war. (I do hope it would get revived in some way)

There were plans for a railway system in Mindanao by the Commonwealth Government in the 1930s but were shelved because of the upcoming war.

Only in today's day and age that there are efforts to put up these new lines that would bring a big help and convenience for most of the commuters and I do hope most of these lines would be completed in the future.

Just imagine with all these lines and stations that it would make commuting more better. And also travelling to the far provinces via train. (Ala Japan/Indonesia vibes)

Just to also share that I was able to experience riding a subway train in Singapore and it was cool with all the underground stations and their different but unique designs. 

And at times I still couldn't believe that the country would have its own Subway system and possibly in this lifetime (Which is also supervised by a Japanese Firm and Company).

Personally, I'm looking forward to experience going to NAIA by taking the Subway system instead of riding a car or taking a taxi thus you'll be greeted by the traffic.

And I know that these train lines would take time to be completed but I guess its better than having nothing at all.","what are your insights regarding a possible railway renaissance in the future?

1lw5nt2,Philippines,The historic Anakin Skywalker Pactores.,"When Anakin and his cousins were still little kids, I always play Dota with them. Since they don't know how to play the game yet, I let them group up so all 5 of them will play against me. I would choose Techies as my hero and plant landmines around the map.

Being new to the game, they would huddle and hunt me. They would run after my hero and shout ""kill Tito Jay"". So I would lead them to where I planted the landmines. And when the landmines explode, they would be shocked by their sudden death and I would mischievously giggle.

As the years pass by, they grew and became familiar with the game and it became difficult to win against them when they play as a team of 5 versus me. Thus, I would ask one of them to be my teammate so it would be 4 vs. 2. Later they became good and it was almost impossible to win against them when it's 4 vs. 2. Hence, we ended up playing 3 vs. 3.

Those were our very memorable bonding moments and the source of a lot of fun and laughter. After our games, we would talk about our games while eating ice cream and bread. His other titos and titas would usually join in during this time and laugh with us as we talk about our in-game bloopers.

What I distinctly remember about Anakin when we played Dota is when the game starts, his cousins and myself would immediately buy our items from the shop and proceed to our respective lanes to do battle with the enemy. But then I would notice that Anakin's chosen Dota character is not yet with us so I would ask, ""where's Anakin?"" And his cousins would reply, ""Tua pa sa base, tito. Nagbasa pa"". 😄😄😄 I would laugh very hard because Anakin would read all the description of the items in the shop that's why he's still in the base when the game starts while the rest of us were fighting the enemy already.

I knew then that Anakin is a smart kid. Very analytical. That is why when he told me that he applied for UP but was not yet informed of the resuts so he might just enroll in another school that has already informed him that he passed their exam, I vigorously convinced him to wait for the UPCA results and not waste the opportunity of studying in our country's premier university.

Fortunately, Anakin really waited for the UPCA results and he learned later on that he passed. And so he enrolled in UP Mindanao and took BS Computer Science in the College of Science and Mathematics in UP Mindanao.

Glad that he chose UP because, now, he makes history by graduating as the class valedictorian with the distinction of being the lone Summa Cum Laude of the College of Science and Mathematics of UP Mindanao in this year's graduation and the first-ever Summa Cum Laude of the Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, UP Mindanao.

When I was first here in UP Mindanao, I was the Student Council President of UP Cebu attending the UP Student Congress. Now, I return with a proud heart being his tito and guest in his graduation accompanying his aunt Coolen who raised him as her own son when his mother passed away. I congratulate and thank Coolen May, John Greenleaf, and Rina May, who are the siblings of Anakin's deceased mother Cherry May, for raising and supporting Anakin all the way..

Listening to Anakin's Valedictory Speech which urged his fellow graduates to be a force for good, I am all the more proud because I can already see that he will always be Anakin Skywalker and will not turn into Darth Vader. Congratulations, Anakin. Padayon! Mabuhay ang mga Iskolar ng Bayan!","the historic anakin skywalker pactores. when anakin and his cousins were still little kids, i always play dota with them. since they don't know how to play the game yet, i let them group up so all 5 of them will play against me. i would choose techies as my hero and plant landmines around the map.

being new to the game, they would huddle and hunt me. they would run after my hero and shout ""kill tito jay"". so i would lead them to where i planted the landmines. and when the landmines explode, they would be shocked by their sudden death and i would mischievously giggle.

as the years pass by, they grew and became familiar with the game and it became difficult to win against them when they play as a team of 5 versus me. thus, i would ask one of them to be my teammate so it would be 4 vs. 2. later they became good and it was almost impossible to win against them when it's 4 vs. 2. hence, we ended up playing 3 vs. 3.

1jy0uqr,Philippines,Miss Universe Philippines 2025 Safest Bet,"Who is the safest and most strategic candidate for MUPH to send to Miss Universe 2025 in Thailand?

This discussion aims to explore who among the current Miss Universe Philippines candidates stands out as the most strategic and internationally competitive delegate for Miss Universe 2025, which will be held in Thailand.

It is worth noting that final decisions in pageantry—especially at the national level—often involve more than just performance during the coronation night. The organization takes into account how well a candidate aligns with the values of the Miss Universe Organization (MUO), her ability to engage with diverse audiences, and her potential to thrive in pre-pageant activities and media events.

Let me emphasize that the following example is purely hypothetical and only meant to illustrate a point. It is not based on confirmed behind-the-scenes information.

In the 2023 edition, many pageant followers believed it was a close call between Alexie Brooks, Ahtisa Manalo, and Christi McGarry—three candidates who each brought distinct strengths to the table. Alexie was considered a standout: beautiful, fit, and eloquent. Ahtisa brought international experience and elegance, while Christi had the stature, confidence, and communication skills of a seasoned competitor.

However, the crown ultimately went to Chelsea Manalo. While both Alexie and Chelsea are Black Filipinas, Chelsea may have been seen as a more strategic choice for the Miss Universe 2024 edition in Mexico, which had already been announced as the host country. Her warmth, relatability, and authentic presence likely made her a stronger fit for the Latin-American audience and pre-pageant environment.

Another possible factor is Miss Universe's tendency to avoid selecting candidates who resemble recent winners too closely. Alexie shares similar facial features and overall impact with Zozibini Tunzi, Miss Universe 2019. While Alexie is undeniably stunning and accomplished, the Miss Universe Philippines organization may have anticipated that MUO would not crown someone with a look and aura so similar to a recent titleholder. The organization values diversity—not just in background, but in image and personality—and usually aims to present something new to the global audience each year.

It’s also important to consider that Miss Universe remains a business. The organization naturally favors candidates who can generate excitement, draw in ticket sales, and attract a strong fan base. A candidate with a dedicated following—willing to spend, travel, and support her both online and onsite—offers added value not only in terms of popularity, but in boosting the commercial success of the event. This is especially true for countries like Thailand, where fan culture and in-person support play a major role in the overall pageant experience.

With Thailand confirmed as the host for 2025, it is crucial that MUPH sends someone who is not only strong in all areas, but also someone the local and international pageant fans can easily rally behind.

The safest and most strategic choice, in my view, is Ma. Ahtisa Manalo of Quezon Province.
She brings international pageant experience as Miss International 2018 1st runner-up, speaks with clarity and composure, and consistently carries herself with quiet confidence. She is well-liked by the public, and her charm is the kind that resonates cross-culturally—making her highly compatible with the Thai audience. Ahtisa also has an established fan base that has consistently shown up for her, which could greatly benefit the Miss Universe Organization in terms of engagement and support.

For context:

Cebu BRT is ""under review"" due to Gov. Gwen's ""concerns"" about Heritage Protection. The merits of which I cannot comment on. On September 11, 2024, Sen. Binay stated in a hearing “It’s high time to cut our losses and decide once and for all if we will continue this project because the bleeding of this project still continues.”

Metro Cebu and even the city itself, despite having a population of 3.1 million and 1 million respectively, have ZERO public transportation aside from traditional jeepneys and ""modern"" jeeps.  
Modern jeep, by the way, from my experience as a student commuter overload on passengers ALOT. And commuting home even at 7pm is a hassle. 

Now, I have built here the approved transport plans for Metro Cebu in a simulation/game called Nimby Rails. Let's discuss its issues. 

Legend:  
Dark Red: Cebu MRT  
Dark Grey: Cebu IT Park - Airport Monorail  
Purple: South Road Properties - IT Park BRT  
Cyan: Talisay - Sout Road Properties feeder  
Dark Blue: Mactan Island Airport Loop (my own plan)  
Pink/Yellow: Cebu to Manila Airlines

A LOT of issues exist with the networks already approved or are tentatively in motion. Cebu MRT struggles during rush hours, even though it is supposed to be a regional network, more local commuters understandably use it to travel from north to south and vice versa. 

Cebu BRT is a network that starts in a commercial area and ends in a commercial area. Although you can use the MRT to go to the BRT stations and then transfer to these high-employment commercial areas, this is still a lot of hassle for commuters. Although from all these networks, Cebu BRT is the only one that can meet passenger needs. 

Cebu Monorail is extremely focused for northern commuters. If you are from the south and wants to go to the airport? Well good luck, you have to take the Metro to Mandaue City and transfer to the Monorail, which is already overcapacity.

A major issue with the proposed plans is that they are poorly planned. The networks, while catering to a large portion of the population, misses a lot of large urban centers. Only a singular metro connects all these areas. 

And another issue, as a student, is that this network misses multiple universities. And caters only CNU and CTI, which while large, are not the largest universities in terms of population. Admittedly, the BRT and MRT Central Hub are moderately walking distance to many universities, I think a good transport network includes direct stops in these major commute areas. 

","amidst the possibility of cebu brt ending. i present ""what if metro cebu finished all its transport projects?"" https://preview.redd.it/gzpu3p6udtod1.png?width=1263&format=png&auto=webp&s=a0988e5f9b191151f7d1d28af469dabd16b8228c

for context:

cebu brt is ""under review"" due to gov. gwen's ""concerns"" about heritage protection. the merits of which i cannot comment on. on september 11, 2024, sen. binay stated in a hearing “it’s high time to cut our losses and decide once and for all if we will continue this project because the bleeding of this project still continues.”

qox5b9,Philippines,University in The Philippines (Cebu),"Hello, I am looking for opportunities to study abroad and I was trying to know more about the universities in The Philippines, however, websites usually don't show the tuition fees and they don't reply to my emails either, so it's really difficult for me to make a list of potential universities as my budget is tight. 

I am interested in studying English there (I am a French native speaker) as a transfer student, starting from the second year of a bachelor degree. I would be interested in studying in Cebu. 

Could anyone help me? 

\- What is the tuition fees for the universities in Cebu? (You can use $,€ or PHP currency, per semester or per year, as long as you precise it).

\- Are the bachelor degrees there recognized internationally? (I don't want to get a BA there and then later realize it is not recognized in Europe).

\- In Korea, they ask me to prove a bank balance statement of 18,000$. Do universities in The Philippines also ask that? 

\- In average, how many hours of class do students have in a day/week?

&#x200B;

Here is a map with the location of the new capital, and a post explaining why Indonesia is moving its capital, [Indonesia’s New Capital: New Nusantarian Era?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IntlScholars/comments/d9h457/indonesias_new_capital_new_nusantarian_era/)

There are four main points of this post are:

1. The Indonesian state sees Filipinos as kindred spirits, largely because Indonesia and the Philippines are large suppliers of overseas migrant labor. In addition, it views Filipinos through Indonesia's ethnic-cultural framework.
2. Based on the total number of civil servants assigned to the new capital, the final population of the new capital will be much larger than the projection circulating in the media. This means the impact will be much larger than anticipated for Indonesia and the Philippines.
3. The Philippines is militarily significant for Indonesia because it was the main invasion route used by the Japanese to invade the Dutch East Indies during the Second World War.  Security presence in the  Celebes-Sulu area will be increased sharply once the capital has been moved.
4. The Philippines is a major export and investment destination for Indonesian companies.   The hope is the new capital will spur the creation of a north-south economic corridor that stretches from Beijing/Seoul to East Java/Central Java. The Philippines will benefit not just from closer ties with Indonesia, but also increased economic and trade flowing from North Asia through this corridor.

Since the fall of Suharto in 1998, there has been an intensification of Indonesian activity in the Indonesian provinces adjacent to the Philippines. As explained in [Indonesia’s New Capital: New Nusantarian Era?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IntlScholars/comments/d9h457/indonesias_new_capital_new_nusantarian_era/) the new capital should be seen as an extension of the process of human settlement that began over 100 years ago. Secondly, there has been marked increased Indonesian engagement with the Philippines, both by the government and the private sector in the last 15 years.  Indonesian investors and brands like Anthoni Salim, JCo Donuts, Alfamart, Mayora Group (Kopiko, Beng Beng) have been in the Philippines market for the last 5-15 years.  There has also increased cooperation between the two countries in increasingly pressing issues like anti-terrorism, border security, and migrant workers. Indonesia's importance to the Philippines will only increase with the new capital.

# HOW THE INDONESIAN STATE SEES FILIPINOS

Indonesia's relations with the Philippines have been good since they were established between the two countries in 1949.

Firstly, the Indonesian state sees Filipino as kindred spirits not such on shared heritage, but because they are large suppliers of migrant laborers to many of the same countries.  About 60% of migrant workers in Taiwan are either Indonesian or Filipino **\[1\]** and 98% of the domestic servants in Hong Kong and Singapore come from Indonesia or the Philippines.**\[2\]**  There are roughly a Million Indonesians **\[3\]** and 4 Million Filipino in the Gulf. **\[4\]** Indonesian and Filipino diplomats in these countries meet regularly to coordinate efforts regarding migrant workers.**\[5\]**

Secondly, the Indonesian state views Filipino through  Indonesia's ethnic-cultural framework.  It sees Filipino as ""cousins"" of the Minahasa, the dominant ethnic group in North Sulawesi, the province adjacent to the Philippines. The way Indonesia appoints ambassadors to the Philippines is similar to how they appoint military/police commanders in Indonesia. Non-Muslims usually get assigned to non-Muslim areas. There have been 17 Indonesian Ambassadors to the Philippines since 1953. six of them were Christian, and of those six, three were Minahasa.**\[6\]** As the relations with the North Sulawesi and the Javanese-controlled central government, relations between Indonesia and the Philippines have been largely smooth.

**The Minahasa**

Are the largest ethnic group in North Sulawesi with a population of 1.2 Million. Here are some relevant points about the Minahasa:

* The Minahasa are largely Austronesian like Filipinos, while much of the rest of Indonesia is mixed Austroasiatics-Austronesian or Austronesian-Melanesian.
* People in North Sulawesi and the neighboring province  Gorontalo speak Philippinic languages.
* Predominantly Christian with most being Dutch Reformed  Church with a minority being Catholic. And like the contemporary  Philippines, there is a big Evangelical movement in North Sulawesi. **\[7\]**
* The region was first colonized by the Spanish in the 1500s, then the Portuguese until the 1660s, and thereafter the Dutch until Indonesian independence.
* It is a very Westernized region of Indonesia, it has been largely Christianized since the early 19th century.
* Under the Dutch, many Minahasa served in the colonial military (KNIL).  The Minahasa was considered loyal to the colonial enterprise, to the extent North Sulawesi was called the 12th province of the Netherlands.**\[8\]**
* Many people in North Sulawesi have European and Chinese ancestry. About 8% of the Minahasa population lives in the Netherlands.  In addition, its the area of Indonesia where the ethnic Chinese are best integrated
* People from North Sulawesi are disproportionately represented in Indonesia's entertainment industries
* Since 1952, in the Philippines, there has been a Consulate in Manado, the capital of North Sulawesi. Indonesia has a consulate in Davao City. Da La Salle Brothers also have a university in the province.

Some compare the Philippines and East Timor, because of Catholicism and the cultural similarities between their colonizers, the Spanish and the Portuguese. First, Filipinos are largely Austronesian, while the East Timorese are mixed Austronesian-Melanesian.  Secondly, unlike in North Sulawesi and the Philippines, there ethnic Chinese and East Timorese are largely segregated, and there are underlying tensions between the two communities  **\[9\]**

# PROJECTIONS FOR INDONESIA'S NEW CAPITAL

The project is set to be enshrined in law this year (2022).  According to the draft law, by the first half of 2024, it will officially be Indonesia's capital **\[10\]**

It is estimated to cost $32 Billion.   One million civil servants are slated to move to the new capital.**\[11\]**

In my opinion, the eventual impact of the move will be much larger than most people will fathom, due to the Indonesian government downplaying the potential size of the capital.  Estimates of the new capital's population range from 2.75 to 4.5 Million. **\[12\]** In my view, it is going to be a lot larger than even 4.5 Million.**\[13\]** Looking at countries like Canada **\[14\]** and Australia, where their capital largeLY functions as the political and administrative capital, public servants make up 35% of the workforce, **\[15\]** or 12% of the population. Roughly one million civil servants working for the central government in Jakarta will move. **\[16\]** This doesn't factor in the municipal level employees, security forces, and staff for Indonesia's State-Owned Enterprises. While Jakarta has a population of 11 Million, many of the civil servants and their families live in the suburbs in West Java.  A more realistic population estimate for the new capital would be about 7-9 Million, this will eventually make it the second-largest city in Indonesia after Jakarta. Another reason why the capital will be larger than the commonly stated predictions is the Indonesian government plans to build an 11,000 MW hydropower complex in the adjacent province of North Kalimantan,  While some of it will be used for a green industrial zone, I suspect much of it will be used for the new capital. **\[17\]**  11,000 MW is a lot of power,  Luzon's total electrical capacity is about 12000 MW supplying a population of 64 Million. **\[18\]**

**Why is the Indonesian government lowballing the new capital's population estimates?**  First, I suspect they don't want to alarm people, particularly in Jakarta. It will shift a significant amount of economic activity out of Jakarta and its surrounding suburbs.  Secondly, a larger population estimate will have people questioning their project cost estimates. It is going to end up costing a lot more than US$32 Billion. Thirdly, Indonesian planners are aware Indonesians don't want to hear another megacity being created. Lastly, a larger population estimate will only worsen the speculative land frenzy in the areas designated for the new capital.

# PHILIPPINES MILITARY SIGNIFICANCE FOR INDONESIA

The Indonesian state sees the Philippines as one of the two invasion routes used by invaders from North Asia. The other is the South China Sea.  During the Japanese Invasion of the Dutch East Indies during the Second World War, the main invasion route was through the Philippines, with the main objective to seize the oil fields in Kalimantan.

Since 2006, Indonesia has shifted military assets northward to Natuna **\[19\]** and the tri-border area (Indonesia-Malaysia-Philippines). **\[20\]** Shifting the capital to Borneo will add a defensive layer that invaders will have to contend with before proceeding to Java.  There has been increased defense cooperation between the two countries, ranging from Indonesia selling Philippines defense assets like 2 Strategic Sealift Vessels and joint patrols in the Sulu Sea.  The Indonesian government was worried about Duterte's pro-China stance because it had taken for granted the strength of the US-Philippines alliance. This along with China's incursion in Natuna in June 2016, most likely resulted in Indonesia resurrecting the first bilateral fighter to fighter training exercises between Indonesia and the US since 1997 (Cope West) in November 2016 in North Sulawesi.**\[21\]**

**IMPROVED SECURITY IN THE SULU SEA REGION**

With the new capital, one will see more military units and assets allocated to Borneo.  At present, there is 20,000 military personnel in Indonesian Borneo (Kalimantan). The few naval and airforce bases are small, there are only two major naval bases and one large air force base.

With the movement of leadership and command elements, this posture will change significantly.    The Armed Forces General Headquarters will move, along with its supporting staff and units, from intelligence groups and military police to special forces and press officers.   The Army will create a new Capital Security Regional Command (KODAM PIK). The new army headquarters and KODAM PIK will require around 15,000 personnel, including an infantry and a cavalry brigade as well as special forces units.  **\[22\]**

The navy will also move its headquarters and supporting units. Current proposals call for a new ‘armada-level’ force, a new division-level marine unit, and a third primary naval base in Kalimantan. The area also needs new port facilities and bases to host and maintain major platforms as well as a new naval airfield. The navy’s transport command and hydrographic service could be relocated there as well.

The air force will move its headquarters and supporting units and create major bases and facilities. Radar and missile defense units along with a special forces battalion and two aviation squadrons could be established near the new capital. Major platforms will be deployed in the area,  **\[23\]**

The significantly increased military presence and patrols on the Indonesian side of the border, increase security and reduce the flow of militants and arms traveling between the two countries.

# NORTH-SOUTH ECONOMIC CORRIDOR

***MAJOR EXPORT AND INVESTMENT DESTINATION***

Indonesia is the Philippines' 10th largest export market and 4th largest source of imports after China, Japan, and South Korea. In 2019 Indonesia's exports to the Philippines were $7.5 Billion, while the Philippines' exports to Indonesia were US$898 Million. **\[24\]** The top three Indonesian exports to the Philippines are vehicles, coal, and packaged food which make up 35%, 25%, and 12% of Indonesian exports. About 57% of the automotive vehicles (cars and motorcycles) imported into the Philippines come from Indonesia.**\[25\]**  Because of proximity, Indonesia supplies about 75% of the coal used in the Philippines. In the last decade, Indonesian products and brands have successfully penetrated the Philippines. The most notable are Mayora (Kopiko, Beng Beng), JCo Donuts, and Alfamart.

The Indonesian businessman, John Riady, once said, ""Indonesia is probably the most invisible country in the world"", and Indonesian businessmen like their country operate discreetly.  Many people think Indonesian brands are local brands, even some Indonesians think some Indonesian brands are non-Indonesian brands.  For example, a couple of days ago, there was this post  [It’s my bday and my father gave me this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/rys4jf/its_my_bday_and_my_father_gave_me_this/). This was one of the comments.

>Happy Birthday gurllll.  
>  
>Also, diba brand ng local chocolate ung Beng Beng? Kalevel sya ng Choco Mucho kemerut if im not mistaken.

Beng Beng is an Indonesian brand and has been produced by Mayora Group since the 1980s.

When talking about Indonesian investors in the Philippines, the two names that stand out are Monde Nissin Group and Anthoni Salim.

Monde Nissin launched the largest IPO in the Philippines' history last year. **\[26\]** It is controlled by a Chinese Indonesian family,  **\[27\]** who owns the Indonesian biscuit company Khong Guan Biscuit Factory Indonesia (KGBI). Khong Guan is originally a Singaporean company founded in 1941. KGBI set up a factory in Indonesia in 1972. The relationship between Khong Guan Singapore and Khong Guan Indonesia is more an association, whereby Khong Guan Indonesia uses the Khong Guan brand and certain recipes. In 1979, Hidayat Darmono, the founder, set up **Monde Nissin in the Philippines.**  The Filipino front person for Monde Nissin is Betty Ang, the Filipino wife of one of Hidayat Barmono's sons, Hoediono Kweefanus. **\[28\]**

Anthoni Salim is Indonesia's 5th richest individual and owns Indofood, the company that owns Indomie, the world's largest instant noodle brand. About 15 years ago, through First Pacific Group in Hong Kong, he made large investments in the Philippines, particularly in infrastructure and telecommunications. First Pacific controls the MVP Group and their Filipino frontman is  Manuel V. Pangilinan.  Through MVP Group, Salim controls PDLT, Smart, Maynilad Water Services and Manila North Tollways. They also indirectly control some of the Philippines' largest media outlets like  Philippine Star, Philippine Daily Inquirer, and TV5. Salim's ownership of Smart was used by Duterte to bring in the Chinese state-controlled investment in cellular services.**\[29\]**

***NORTH-SOUTH ECONOMIC CORRIDOR***

Since the current President Joko Widodo took over, there has been a concerted effort to strengthen Indonesia's border areas, not just in defense, but also infrastructure and economic connectivity with bordering countries.**\[30\]** However, the Philippines is of particular importance, because it's part of the economic corridor connecting North Asia to Eastern Indonesia. In the 15th century and earlier traders would travel southward from China to Spice Islands to buy cloves; however, as a result of the Spanish restricting southbound trade, since the 16th century, this economic corridor has been largely dormant as trade shifted to South China Seas.**\[31\]**  Before Spanish colonialism, the dominant outside cultural influence was from Southern trade routes, whether Islam or Hindu-Buddhism.

The Indonesian government wouldn't be trying to promote this economic corridor, and by extension moving the capital to Borneo, if there wasn't underlying economic reasoning. Much of Indonesia's exports of coal, palm oil, and processed metals -- come from Eastern Indonesia. And is also critical for China, Almost, 70% of China's coal imports come from Indonesia and the bulk of its processed nickel is used for stainless steel and EV batteries.  Even China's shipments of Australian coal and iron ore pass through this region. **\[32\]**  Since 2014, Indonesia has placed a ban on the export of raw nickel ore and requires mining companies to build smelters.  Before the ban, Indonesia was the world's largest exporter of nickel ore with 30% of the market.  In 2022, they will ban the export of all raw metal ores.**\[33\]** Here is a table showing the number of smelters for various metals.**\[34\]**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/6jp4voivcra81.jpg?width=560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a163328ab94acf84c91de2779620c895a9eb96a5

At present, the smelters are concentrated in two industrial parks adjacent to the Philippines.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ov7tzw3pgra81.jpg?width=778&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7fa7d636d527a154f3f38565a23ec42899e11115

**Tembaga - Copper, Nikel - Nickel, Bauskit - Bauxite, Besi - Iron,  Mangan - Magnesium, Timbal - Lead, Seng - Zinc.** There are a couple of other metals not included in the chart like Tin and Cobalt, which Indonesia also has smelters.  Smelting is a sector where China has undercut the competition in the last 40 years. For example, North America (the US and Canada) has in total 4 Nickel Smelters (3 in Canada and one in the US.**\[35\]**

While the nickel export ban is often associated with an investment in EV batteries facilities in Indonesia, \[**36\]** the original intention was to get more value-added exports instead of just exporting raw nickel ore. This year, its expected Indonesia will displace China as the world's largest exporter of nickel pig iron **\[37\]**, and next year it will most likely be the world's top exporter of stainless steel.**\[38\]**

**NOTE:** The Philippines is trying to follow in Indonesia's footsteps, but it still has a long way to go.  Recently, Duterte has [lifted the ](https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1419780/duterte-lifts-9-year-ban-on-new-mining-deals)[9-year ban on new mining deals](https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1419780/duterte-lifts-9-year-ban-on-new-mining-deals) and [open-pit mining.](https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/philippines-lifts-four-year-old-ban-open-pit-mining-2021-12-28/)  In 2017, Duterte was eyeing a b[an on nickel ore, but it didn't materialize.](https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/philippines-lifts-four-year-old-ban-open-pit-mining-2021-12-28/)  Mining in the Philippines is a sensitive topic, most likely because most of the mines are in relatively densely populated areas, Whereas in Indonesia, they are mostly located in much more sparsely populated outer islands (outside Java), Mining is an underrated industry when it comes to industrialization. China, South Korea, and Taiwan all had large mining sectors during the initial stages of their development. For South Korea from 1960-the 1980s, mining contributed about 4-8% of its GDP.  At one point 50% in the 1960s, Tungsten made up almost 50% of South Korea's goods exports.

***MALACCA STRAIT VS JAVA RIVALRY: TIPPING THE BALANCE***

The Malacca Strait civilizations, whether in Sumatra or the Malay Peninsula, and those on Java have vacillated between cooperation, rivalry, and sometimes war for over a millennium.  The rivalry was one between geography and wealth (Malacca Strait) vs productive capacity and population (Java).

* 683-1025 Srivijaya Empire. Lasted until 1288, but went into decline after the 1025 Chola Invasion. Chola Empire was a Southern Indian polity.
* 1288-1400 Singhasari-Majapahit Empire (Java)
* 1400-1528 Malacca Sultanate (Malacca Strait)
* 1511-1642 Portuguese Malacca vs various Javanese Kingdoms (At Parity)
* 1643-1825 Dutch East Indies (Java)
* 1825-1930 British Malaya vs Dutch East Indies (At Parity)
* 1930-Now British Malaya / Malaysia-Singapore (Malacca Strait) **\[39\]**

**Note:**  In the 1960s Singapore was the richest area in Asia outside Metropolitan Tokyo and Hong Kong, what Lee Kuan Yew is made it [more equal](https://newnaratif.com/justifying-colonial-rule-in-post-colonial-singapore/).  Malacca strait civilization by geography is fabulously wealthy.  Here is a Guardian story about  Indonesian treasure hunters possibly finding the 7-13th century capital of [Sriwijaya Empire often referred to as the Island of Gold.](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/oct/22/have-sumatran-fishing-crews-found-the-fabled-island-of-gold) **\[40\]** Some of the antique dealers in Palembang, the city located near the supposed capital, have collections of antiques that surpass what is found in major museums in the Philippines.  Secondly, Singapore is a classic Southeast Asian entity, a state with a small geographical area much like Sriwijaya, Majapahit and Tondo was. Until the 19th century, outside Java, controlling a lot of infertile tropical land in Maritime Southeast Asia wasn't viable.

The Konfrontasi between Indonesia vs Malaysia-Singapore could be seen in this light.   Coupled with the long-standing rivalry and contemporary issues there is an underlying tension between the Javanese-dominated Indonesia and Malay-centered Malaysia.  Issues range from Malaysian mistreatment of Indonesian workers (mostly Javanese) and Malaysia's harboring / support of separatists (GAM - Free Aceh Movement)  and radicals such as Abu Bakar Bashir.  For Malaysia, its haze from plantations in Indonesia and the culture wars with Indonesia. **\[41\]**

Indonesia's moving the capital to Borneo is part of a long-standing goal to develop areas outside Java and Sumatra.**\[42\]**  Secondly, with Jakarta no longer the capital, it will give cities in Central and East Java, the homeland of Indonesia's dominant ethnic group, the Javanese, a level playing field with Jakarta.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/45vynebzcra81.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ecc079d9d254f9b54633e5579c92ecdb020bd624

**NOTE:** The Baduy and Banten are often considered sub-group of Sundanese. While the Tengger and Osing are subgroups of the Javanese.

Even before the Spanish arrived, Manila has been the dominant city in the Philippines; however, in the case of Indonesia, Jakarta's preeminence only began in the 1930s.  For example, in1930, the two main port cities in Central and East Java, Semarang and Surabaya had a respective population of 218,000 and 342,000 vs 435,000 for Batavia (Jakarta). In 2020, it was 1.6 Million, 2.9 Million vs 11 Million. \[**43\]** The rapid rise of Jakarta has to do with the collapse of the sugar industry in the 1930s and government centralization.  Since 2014, with the election of the current President, there has been a concerted effort to spread economic development across Java from West to East.  Here is a list of completed and planned projects that further this objective.

* Completion of Trans-Java Toll Road in 2019.**\[44\]**
* Completion of two Industrial Estates in Central Java (Kendal - 2016, Batang - 2020).
* 2000 MW Power Plant in Batang in 2020.
* Completion of new Yogyakarta International Airport in 2019.
* US$ 1.1 Billion Expansion of Tanjung Emas port in Semarang. **\[45\]**
* Two High-Speed Railway Lines across Java, a southern route funded by China and a northern route funded by Japan. **\[46\]**
* Broken ground on the world's largest copper smelter in Gresik, East Java. **\[47\]**

While efforts by current President Joko Widodo have been noticeable, the plans were made during the administration of his predecessor, Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono.

One of the main impetus behind developing East and Central Java is scaling down of the transmigration program, during the 1990s they were sending 120,000 Javanese and Balinese families every year, now it's 1000-1500 per year.  **\[48\]**

With the new capital along with smelters in Eastern Indonesia, the Indonesian government hopes to create an economic corridor in Southeast Asia that stretches from Philippines-New Capital-Makassar-East/Central Java that will shift economic activity from the Malacca Strait. The Indonesian control of nickel mines in the former Spice Islands is similar to Majapahit's control of these islands during the spice trade.  The last time this North-South corridor was active in the 16th century, the Philippines consisted of scattered tribes / small city-states with a total estimated population of 500,000 versus 110 Million today. **\[49\]**

**INCREASED FLIGHT CONNECTIONS AND TOURISM**

The new capital will serve as a flight hub for Central and Eastern Indonesia. At present, if you live in cities in Eastern Indonesia like Makassar, Sulawesi, or Jayapura, Papua, if you want to fly to Manila it would mean flying to Bali or Jakarta before flying to Manila.  It will cut the flying time from Manila to Eastern Indonesia by 2-3 hours.  For example, it will open up new and shorter routes for Filipinos wanting to travel to Indonesia not living in Manila. At present, if you are living in Makassar if you want to fly to the Philippines it would mean flying to Jakarta before flying to Manila.

Secondly, the new capital will not just impact travel between the two countries, but also increase traffic flows from East Asia. Flights going into Eastern Indonesia fly through Jakarta or Bali first. The only direct flights into Eastern Indonesia from China or Japan are charter.  Because the Philippines is on the flight path between East Asian cities like Seoul, Shanghai, and Taipei and the new capital, some of the flights could stopover in Manila or Cebu.  If the airports in Manila and Cebu were greatly improved they could serve as hubs for flights from East Asia into Eastern Indonesia and Australia.

In 2019, the Indonesian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (Kadin) suggested the two countries work together to offer joint tour packages.**\[50\]** However, with the new capital, such proposals become more realistic given the increased flight connectivity between Southern Philippines and Eastern Indonesia with the new capital serving as a hub.

**INCREASED** **ECONOMIC TIES**

The capital move will amplify existing trends, and push companies and individuals that are sitting on the fence with regards to investing or marketing their products in the other country.  Broadly speaking, there will be increased economic ties between the two countries after the move, since the capitals will be significantly closer

Moving the capital to the area involved in the processing of nickel will accelerate the development of nickel-related products like stainless steel and EV batteries. It wouldn't be a stretch to argue within a decade nearly all the EV vehicles, 4 and 2 wheels, sold in the Philippines would be imported from Indonesia. This dominance will be further entrenched by the fact Hyundai is setting up its first factory in Southeast Asia in Indonesia to export most of its production to the rest of Southeast Asia and Australia.**\[51\]** LG Chemicals and Hyundai began construction of Southeast Asia's first EV battery plant this month in Indonesia. **\[52\]**

Secondly, the new capital will create a new economic center and logistics hub for Indonesia that will reduce logistic costs.  It will serve as a springboard for Indonesian companies wanting to market their products in East Malaysia and the Philippines, and for Filipino companies wishing to do so in Indonesia. Filipino's will most likely see more Indonesian consumer goods at supermarkets and Alfamart.

Thirdly, the new capital will boast the Mindanao and Cebu economy, which will help the Philippines ' efforts to decentralize its economy from Metro Manila.**\[53\]**  The Philippines education sector could benefit from increased demand from Indonesia; however, this depends on marketing efforts by both educational institutes and the government.

# CONCLUSION

Indonesia's current ties with the Philippines are comprehensive, and it covers a wide range of areas from investment, trade, border security,  anti-terrorism, and migrant issues.   A lot of issues have a direct impact on the Philippines and the lives of ordinary Filipinos but are rarely talked about in the Philippines' press.

there are four main points of this post are:

1. the indonesian state sees filipinos as kindred spirits, largely because indonesia and the philippines are large suppliers of overseas migrant labor. in addition, it views filipinos through indonesia's ethnic-cultural framework.
2. based on the total number of civil servants assigned to the new capital, the final population of the new capital will be much larger than the projection circulating in the media. this means the impact will be much larger than anticipated for indonesia and the philippines.
3. the philippines is militarily significant for indonesia because it was the main invasion route used by the japanese to invade the dutch east indies during the second world war.  security presence in the  celebes-sulu area will be increased sharply once the capital has been moved.
4. the philippines is a major export and investment destination for indonesian companies.   the hope is the new capital will spur the creation of a north-south economic corridor that stretches from beijing/seoul to east java/central java. the philippines will benefit not just from closer ties with indonesia, but also increased economic and trade flowing from north asia through this corridor.

since the fall of suharto in 1998, there has been an intensification of indonesian activity in the indonesian provinces adjacent to the philippines. as explained in [indonesia’s new capital: new nusantarian era?](https://www.reddit.com/r/intlscholars/comments/d9h457/indonesias_new_capital_new_nusantarian_era/) the new capital should be seen as an extension of the process of human settlement that began over 100 years ago. secondly, there has been marked increased indonesian engagement with the philippines, both by the government and the private sector in the last 15 years.  indonesian investors and brands like anthoni salim, jco donuts, alfamart, mayora group (kopiko, beng beng) have been in the philippines market for the last 5-15 years.  there has also increased cooperation between the two countries in increasingly pressing issues like anti-terrorism, border security, and migrant workers. indonesia's importance to the philippines will only increase with the new capital.

# how the indonesian state sees filipinos

indonesia's relations with the philippines have been good since they were established between the two countries in 1949.

firstly, the indonesian state sees filipino as kindred spirits not such on shared heritage, but because they are large suppliers of migrant laborers to many of the same countries.  about 60% of migrant workers in taiwan are either indonesian or filipino **\[1\]** and 98% of the domestic servants in hong kong and singapore come from indonesia or the philippines.**\[2\]**  there are roughly a million indonesians **\[3\]** and 4 million filipino in the gulf. **\[4\]** indonesian and filipino diplomats in these countries meet regularly to coordinate efforts regarding migrant workers.**\[5\]**

secondly, the indonesian state views filipino through  indonesia's ethnic-cultural framework.  it sees filipino as ""cousins"" of the minahasa, the dominant ethnic group in north sulawesi, the province adjacent to the philippines. the way indonesia appoints ambassadors to the philippines is similar to how they appoint military/police commanders in indonesia. non-muslims usually get assigned to non-muslim areas. there have been 17 indonesian ambassadors to the philippines since 1953. six of them were christian, and of those six, three were minahasa.**\[6\]** as the relations with the north sulawesi and the javanese-controlled central government, relations between indonesia and the philippines have been largely smooth.

**the minahasa**

are the largest ethnic group in north sulawesi with a population of 1.2 million. here are some relevant points about the minahasa:

* the minahasa are largely austronesian like filipinos, while much of the rest of indonesia is mixed austroasiatics-austronesian or austronesian-melanesian.
* people in north sulawesi and the neighboring province  gorontalo speak philippinic languages.
* predominantly christian with most being dutch reformed  church with a minority being catholic. and like the contemporary  philippines, there is a big evangelical movement in north sulawesi. **\[7\]**
* the region was first colonized by the spanish in the 1500s, then the portuguese until the 1660s, and thereafter the dutch until indonesian independence.
* it is a very westernized region of indonesia, it has been largely christianized since the early 19th century.
* under the dutch, many minahasa served in the colonial military (knil).  the minahasa was considered loyal to the colonial enterprise, to the extent north sulawesi was called the 12th province of the netherlands.**\[8\]**
* many people in north sulawesi have european and chinese ancestry. about 8% of the minahasa population lives in the netherlands.  in addition, its the area of indonesia where the ethnic chinese are best integrated
* people from north sulawesi are disproportionately represented in indonesia's entertainment industries
* since 1952, in the philippines, there has been a consulate in manado, the capital of north sulawesi. indonesia has a consulate in davao city. da la salle brothers also have a university in the province.

some compare the philippines and east timor, because of catholicism and the cultural similarities between their colonizers, the spanish and the portuguese. first, filipinos are largely austronesian, while the east timorese are mixed austronesian-melanesian.  secondly, unlike in north sulawesi and the philippines, there ethnic chinese and east timorese are largely segregated, and there are underlying tensions between the two communities  **\[9\]**

# projections for indonesia's new capital

the project is set to be enshrined in law this year (2022).  according to the draft law, by the first half of 2024, it will officially be indonesia's capital **\[10\]**

it is estimated to cost $32 billion.   one million civil servants are slated to move to the new capital.**\[11\]**

in my opinion, the eventual impact of the move will be much larger than most people will fathom, due to the indonesian government downplaying the potential size of the capital.  estimates of the new capital's population range from 2.75 to 4.5 million. **\[12\]** in my view, it is going to be a lot larger than even 4.5 million.**\[13\]** looking at countries like canada **\[14\]** and australia, where their capital largely functions as the political and administrative capital, public servants make up 35% of the workforce, **\[15\]** or 12% of the population. roughly one million civil servants working for the central government in jakarta will move. **\[16\]** this doesn't factor in the municipal level employees, security forces, and staff for indonesia's state-owned enterprises. while jakarta has a population of 11 million, many of the civil servants and their families live in the suburbs in west java.  a more realistic population estimate for the new capital would be about 7-9 million, this will eventually make it the second-largest city in indonesia after jakarta. another reason why the capital will be larger than the commonly stated predictions is the indonesian government plans to build an 11,000 mw hydropower complex in the adjacent province of north kalimantan,  while some of it will be used for a green industrial zone, i suspect much of it will be used for the new capital. **\[17\]**  11,000 mw is a lot of power,  luzon's total electrical capacity is about 12000 mw supplying a population of 64 million. **\[18\]**

**why is the indonesian government lowballing the new capital's population estimates?**  first, i suspect they don't want to alarm people, particularly in jakarta. it will shift a significant amount of economic activity out of jakarta and its surrounding suburbs.  secondly, a larger population estimate will have people questioning their project cost estimates. it is going to end up costing a lot more than us$32 billion. thirdly, indonesian planners are aware indonesians don't want to hear another megacity being created. lastly, a larger population estimate will only worsen the speculative land frenzy in the areas designated for the new capital.

# philippines military significance for indonesia

the indonesian state sees the philippines as one of the two invasion routes used by invaders from north asia. the other is the south china sea.  during the japanese invasion of the dutch east indies during the second world war, the main invasion route was through the philippines, with the main objective to seize the oil fields in kalimantan.

since 2006, indonesia has shifted military assets northward to natuna **\[19\]** and the tri-border area (indonesia-malaysia-philippines). **\[20\]** shifting the capital to borneo will add a defensive layer that invaders will have to contend with before proceeding to java.  there has been increased defense cooperation between the two countries, ranging from indonesia selling philippines defense assets like 2 strategic sealift vessels and joint patrols in the sulu sea.  the indonesian government was worried about duterte's pro-china stance because it had taken for granted the strength of the us-philippines alliance. this along with china's incursion in natuna in june 2016, most likely resulted in indonesia resurrecting the first bilateral fighter to fighter training exercises between indonesia and the us since 1997 (cope west) in november 2016 in north sulawesi.**\[21\]**

**improved security in the sulu sea region**

with the new capital, one will see more military units and assets allocated to borneo.  at present, there is 20,000 military personnel in indonesian borneo (kalimantan). the few naval and airforce bases are small, there are only two major naval bases and one large air force base.

with the movement of leadership and command elements, this posture will change significantly.    the armed forces general headquarters will move, along with its supporting staff and units, from intelligence groups and military police to special forces and press officers.   the army will create a new capital security regional command (kodam pik). the new army headquarters and kodam pik will require around 15,000 personnel, including an infantry and a cavalry brigade as well as special forces units.  **\[22\]**

the navy will also move its headquarters and supporting units. current proposals call for a new ‘armada-level’ force, a new division-level marine unit, and a third primary naval base in kalimantan. the area also needs new port facilities and bases to host and maintain major platforms as well as a new naval airfield. the navy’s transport command and hydrographic service could be relocated there as well.

the air force will move its headquarters and supporting units and create major bases and facilities. radar and missile defense units along with a special forces battalion and two aviation squadrons could be established near the new capital. major platforms will be deployed in the area,  **\[23\]**

the significantly increased military presence and patrols on the indonesian side of the border, increase security and reduce the flow of militants and arms traveling between the two countries.

# north-south economic corridor

***major export and investment destination***

indonesia is the philippines' 10th largest export market and 4th largest source of imports after china, japan, and south korea. in 2019 indonesia's exports to the philippines were $7.5 billion, while the philippines' exports to indonesia were us$898 million. **\[24\]** the top three indonesian exports to the philippines are vehicles, coal, and packaged food which make up 35%, 25%, and 12% of indonesian exports. about 57% of the automotive vehicles (cars and motorcycles) imported into the philippines come from indonesia.**\[25\]**  because of proximity, indonesia supplies about 75% of the coal used in the philippines. in the last decade, indonesian products and brands have successfully penetrated the philippines. the most notable are mayora (kopiko, beng beng), jco donuts, and alfamart.

the indonesian businessman, john riady, once said, ""indonesia is probably the most invisible country in the world"", and indonesian businessmen like their country operate discreetly.  many people think indonesian brands are local brands, even some indonesians think some indonesian brands are non-indonesian brands.  for example, a couple of days ago, there was this post  [it’s my bday and my father gave me this](https://www.reddit.com/r/philippines/comments/rys4jf/its_my_bday_and_my_father_gave_me_this/). this was one of the comments.

>happy birthday gurllll.  
>  
>also, diba brand ng local chocolate ung beng beng? kalevel sya ng choco mucho kemerut if im not mistaken.

beng beng is an indonesian brand and has been produced by mayora group since the 1980s.

when talking about indonesian investors in the philippines, the two names that stand out are monde nissin group and anthoni salim.

monde nissin launched the largest ipo in the philippines' history last year. **\[26\]** it is controlled by a chinese indonesian family,  **\[27\]** who owns the indonesian biscuit company khong guan biscuit factory indonesia (kgbi). khong guan is originally a singaporean company founded in 1941. kgbi set up a factory in indonesia in 1972. the relationship between khong guan singapore and khong guan indonesia is more an association, whereby khong guan indonesia uses the khong guan brand and certain recipes. in 1979, hidayat darmono, the founder, set up **monde nissin in the philippines.**  the filipino front person for monde nissin is betty ang, the filipino wife of one of hidayat barmono's sons, hoediono kweefanus. **\[28\]**

anthoni salim is indonesia's 5th richest individual and owns indofood, the company that owns indomie, the world's largest instant noodle brand. about 15 years ago, through first pacific group in hong kong, he made large investments in the philippines, particularly in infrastructure and telecommunications. first pacific controls the mvp group and their filipino frontman is  manuel v. pangilinan.  through mvp group, salim controls pdlt, smart, maynilad water services and manila north tollways. they also indirectly control some of the philippines' largest media outlets like  philippine star, philippine daily inquirer, and tv5. salim's ownership of smart was used by duterte to bring in the chinese state-controlled investment in cellular services.**\[29\]**

***north-south economic corridor***

since the current president joko widodo took over, there has been a concerted effort to strengthen indonesia's border areas, not just in defense, but also infrastructure and economic connectivity with bordering countries.**\[30\]** however, the philippines is of particular importance, because it's part of the economic corridor connecting north asia to eastern indonesia. in the 15th century and earlier traders would travel southward from china to spice islands to buy cloves; however, as a result of the spanish restricting southbound trade, since the 16th century, this economic corridor has been largely dormant as trade shifted to south china seas.**\[31\]**  before spanish colonialism, the dominant outside cultural influence was from southern trade routes, whether islam or hindu-buddhism.

the indonesian government wouldn't be trying to promote this economic corridor, and by extension moving the capital to borneo, if there wasn't underlying economic reasoning. much of indonesia's exports of coal, palm oil, and processed metals -- come from eastern indonesia. and is also critical for china, almost, 70% of china's coal imports come from indonesia and the bulk of its processed nickel is used for stainless steel and ev batteries.  even china's shipments of australian coal and iron ore pass through this region. **\[32\]**  since 2014, indonesia has placed a ban on the export of raw nickel ore and requires mining companies to build smelters.  before the ban, indonesia was the world's largest exporter of nickel ore with 30% of the market.  in 2022, they will ban the export of all raw metal ores.**\[33\]** here is a table showing the number of smelters for various metals.**\[34\]**

&#x200b;

https://preview.redd.it/6jp4voivcra81.jpg?width=560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a163328ab94acf84c91de2779620c895a9eb96a5

at present, the smelters are concentrated in two industrial parks adjacent to the philippines.

&#x200b;

https://preview.redd.it/ov7tzw3pgra81.jpg?width=778&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7fa7d636d527a154f3f38565a23ec42899e11115

**tembaga - copper, nikel - nickel, bauskit - bauxite, besi - iron,  mangan - magnesium, timbal - lead, seng - zinc.** there are a couple of other metals not included in the chart like tin and cobalt, which indonesia also has smelters.  smelting is a sector where china has undercut the competition in the last 40 years. for example, north america (the us and canada) has in total 4 nickel smelters (3 in canada and one in the us.**\[35\]**

while the nickel export ban is often associated with an investment in ev batteries facilities in indonesia, \[**36\]** the original intention was to get more value-added exports instead of just exporting raw nickel ore. this year, its expected indonesia will displace china as the world's largest exporter of nickel pig iron **\[37\]**, and next year it will most likely be the world's top exporter of stainless steel.**\[38\]**

**note:** the philippines is trying to follow in indonesia's footsteps, but it still has a long way to go.  recently, duterte has [lifted the ](https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1419780/duterte-lifts-9-year-ban-on-new-mining-deals)[9-year ban on new mining deals](https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1419780/duterte-lifts-9-year-ban-on-new-mining-deals) and [open-pit mining.](https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/philippines-lifts-four-year-old-ban-open-pit-mining-2021-12-28/)  in 2017, duterte was eyeing a b[an on nickel ore, but it didn't materialize.](https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/philippines-lifts-four-year-old-ban-open-pit-mining-2021-12-28/)  mining in the philippines is a sensitive topic, most likely because most of the mines are in relatively densely populated areas, whereas in indonesia, they are mostly located in much more sparsely populated outer islands (outside java), mining is an underrated industry when it comes to industrialization. china, south korea, and taiwan all had large mining sectors during the initial stages of their development. for south korea from 1960-the 1980s, mining contributed about 4-8% of its gdp.  at one point 50% in the 1960s, tungsten made up almost 50% of south korea's goods exports.

***malacca strait vs java rivalry: tipping the balance***

the malacca strait civilizations, whether in sumatra or the malay peninsula, and those on java have vacillated between cooperation, rivalry, and sometimes war for over a millennium.  the rivalry was one between geography and wealth (malacca strait) vs productive capacity and population (java).

* 683-1025 srivijaya empire. lasted until 1288, but went into decline after the 1025 chola invasion. chola empire was a southern indian polity.
* 1288-1400 singhasari-majapahit empire (java)
* 1400-1528 malacca sultanate (malacca strait)
* 1511-1642 portuguese malacca vs various javanese kingdoms (at parity)
* 1643-1825 dutch east indies (java)
* 1825-1930 british malaya vs dutch east indies (at parity)
* 1930-now british malaya / malaysia-singapore (malacca strait) **\[39\]**

**note:**  in the 1960s singapore was the richest area in asia outside metropolitan tokyo and hong kong, what lee kuan yew is made it [more equal](https://newnaratif.com/justifying-colonial-rule-in-post-colonial-singapore/).  malacca strait civilization by geography is fabulously wealthy.  here is a guardian story about  indonesian treasure hunters possibly finding the 7-13th century capital of [sriwijaya empire often referred to as the island of gold.](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/oct/22/have-sumatran-fishing-crews-found-the-fabled-island-of-gold) **\[40\]** some of the antique dealers in palembang, the city located near the supposed capital, have collections of antiques that surpass what is found in major museums in the philippines.  secondly, singapore is a classic southeast asian entity, a state with a small geographical area much like sriwijaya, majapahit and tondo was. until the 19th century, outside java, controlling a lot of infertile tropical land in maritime southeast asia wasn't viable.

the konfrontasi between indonesia vs malaysia-singapore could be seen in this light.   coupled with the long-standing rivalry and contemporary issues there is an underlying tension between the javanese-dominated indonesia and malay-centered malaysia.  issues range from malaysian mistreatment of indonesian workers (mostly javanese) and malaysia's harboring / support of separatists (gam - free aceh movement)  and radicals such as abu bakar bashir.  for malaysia, its haze from plantations in indonesia and the culture wars with indonesia. **\[41\]**

indonesia's moving the capital to borneo is part of a long-standing goal to develop areas outside java and sumatra.**\[42\]**  secondly, with jakarta no longer the capital, it will give cities in central and east java, the homeland of indonesia's dominant ethnic group, the javanese, a level playing field with jakarta.

&#x200b;

https://preview.redd.it/45vynebzcra81.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ecc079d9d254f9b54633e5579c92ecdb020bd624

**note:** the baduy and banten are often considered sub-group of sundanese. while the tengger and osing are subgroups of the javanese.

even before the spanish arrived, manila has been the dominant city in the philippines; however, in the case of indonesia, jakarta's preeminence only began in the 1930s.  for example, in1930, the two main port cities in central and east java, semarang and surabaya had a respective population of 218,000 and 342,000 vs 435,000 for batavia (jakarta). in 2020, it was 1.6 million, 2.9 million vs 11 million. \[**43\]** the rapid rise of jakarta has to do with the collapse of the sugar industry in the 1930s and government centralization.  since 2014, with the election of the current president, there has been a concerted effort to spread economic development across java from west to east.  here is a list of completed and planned projects that further this objective.

* completion of trans-java toll road in 2019.**\[44\]**
* completion of two industrial estates in central java (kendal - 2016, batang - 2020).
* 2000 mw power plant in batang in 2020.
* completion of new yogyakarta international airport in 2019.
* us$ 1.1 billion expansion of tanjung emas port in semarang. **\[45\]**
* two high-speed railway lines across java, a southern route funded by china and a northern route funded by japan. **\[46\]**
* broken ground on the world's largest copper smelter in gresik, east java. **\[47\]**

while efforts by current president joko widodo have been noticeable, the plans were made during the administration of his predecessor, susilo bambang yudhoyono.

one of the main impetus behind developing east and central java is scaling down of the transmigration program, during the 1990s they were sending 120,000 javanese and balinese families every year, now it's 1000-1500 per year.  **\[48\]**

with the new capital along with smelters in eastern indonesia, the indonesian government hopes to create an economic corridor in southeast asia that stretches from philippines-new capital-makassar-east/central java that will shift economic activity from the malacca strait. the indonesian control of nickel mines in the former spice islands is similar to majapahit's control of these islands during the spice trade.  the last time this north-south corridor was active in the 16th century, the philippines consisted of scattered tribes / small city-states with a total estimated population of 500,000 versus 110 million today. **\[49\]**

**increased flight connections and tourism**

the new capital will serve as a flight hub for central and eastern indonesia. at present, if you live in cities in eastern indonesia like makassar, sulawesi, or jayapura, papua, if you want to fly to manila it would mean flying to bali or jakarta before flying to manila.  it will cut the flying time from manila to eastern indonesia by 2-3 hours.  for example, it will open up new and shorter routes for filipinos wanting to travel to indonesia not living in manila. at present, if you are living in makassar if you want to fly to the philippines it would mean flying to jakarta before flying to manila.

secondly, the new capital will not just impact travel between the two countries, but also increase traffic flows from east asia. flights going into eastern indonesia fly through jakarta or bali first. the only direct flights into eastern indonesia from china or japan are charter.  because the philippines is on the flight path between east asian cities like seoul, shanghai, and taipei and the new capital, some of the flights could stopover in manila or cebu.  if the airports in manila and cebu were greatly improved they could serve as hubs for flights from east asia into eastern indonesia and australia.

in 2019, the indonesian chamber of commerce and industry (kadin) suggested the two countries work together to offer joint tour packages.**\[50\]** however, with the new capital, such proposals become more realistic given the increased flight connectivity between southern philippines and eastern indonesia with the new capital serving as a hub.

**increased** **economic ties**

the capital move will amplify existing trends, and push companies and individuals that are sitting on the fence with regards to investing or marketing their products in the other country.  broadly speaking, there will be increased economic ties between the two countries after the move, since the capitals will be significantly closer

moving the capital to the area involved in the processing of nickel will accelerate the development of nickel-related products like stainless steel and ev batteries. it wouldn't be a stretch to argue within a decade nearly all the ev vehicles, 4 and 2 wheels, sold in the philippines would be imported from indonesia. this dominance will be further entrenched by the fact hyundai is setting up its first factory in southeast asia in indonesia to export most of its production to the rest of southeast asia and australia.**\[51\]** lg chemicals and hyundai began construction of southeast asia's first ev battery plant this month in indonesia. **\[52\]**

secondly, the new capital will create a new economic center and logistics hub for indonesia that will reduce logistic costs.  it will serve as a springboard for indonesian companies wanting to market their products in east malaysia and the philippines, and for filipino companies wishing to do so in indonesia. filipino's will most likely see more indonesian consumer goods at supermarkets and alfamart.

thirdly, the new capital will boast the mindanao and cebu economy, which will help the philippines ' efforts to decentralize its economy from metro manila.**\[53\]**  the philippines education sector could benefit from increased demand from indonesia; however, this depends on marketing efforts by both educational institutes and the government.

# conclusion

indonesia's current ties with the philippines are comprehensive, and it covers a wide range of areas from investment, trade, border security,  anti-terrorism, and migrant issues.   a lot of issues have a direct impact on the philippines and the lives of ordinary filipinos but are rarely talked about in the philippines' press.

18dexdn,Philippines,[DISCUSSION] Our HUGE population doesn't have to be a curse or weakness,"**The goal of this post is to start some nice good discussions. I didnt post this to preach my opinion** 

Our population can actually be an asset if we can take advantage of its potential

(I know...given the kind of government we have, that's a big **IF**)

Currently, our population sits at 115 Million

It is projected to reach 116 Million in 2024 or 2025. Our population growth rate was actually decreasing steadily since the 1950's, and the rate only increased in 2020. That's almost 70yrs of continued decrease in population growth rate. 

NOTE: decreasing growth rate from 1950-2020 does not mean decreasing in total population number, it means it's decreasing in ratio. Decreased rate means our population was growing all those years, but it is growing at a very slow rate

Basically from 1950-2020 we were growing very slowly, but from 2020 up until today we're growing faster

Now, let's talk about numbers (and i'll keep it very simple)

Here are some of our population stats that are actually GOOD:

* The Philippines have 115 Million people, and 61% are in their ""prime years"" (age 15 to 64)

* According to demographers, ages 15 to 64 are called ""prime years"" because that's the age when people are productive. According to them, age 15 is where more people either (a) pursue higher education (college/university), (b) get employed at a job, or (c) start a business. All three of those paths are crucial for a country's growth. And age 64 is when most people are physically incapable of doing a lot of work

* The Philippines having 61% in the prime years does not automatically mean all those people are in those 3 categories I listed on the point above, it just means 61% should be capable of doing those 3

* 61% isn't that good, but it's also not that bad...it's just okay. It's only bad because a lot of those in the 61% are not maximized to their potential (I will explain later)

* On the other hand, 34.6% of our population are considered ""children"" (Age 0-14). This is actually good for the future of this country, because these children will be our ""work force"" in the future. There's a misconception that fewer births are good because there are fewer mouths to feed, which means less expenses. That is **NOT** true. Fewer children means that there will be less people who will grow up to become part of the ""prime years"" in the future. And as we established in the points above, it's bad if the country has few people in the ""prime years"" category

* 34.6% of our population as children is good, the only issue here is if we can make sure these children actually grow up with a secure future (again, big **IF** with this kind of government)

* To prove that this is actually a good thing, just look at Japan. Today, they have a good ""prime year"" number (64%), which is good right now. But their government is actually worried for the future of their country, because they only have 13% in the children category. And that's seriously BAD, because only few people will grow up to be productive. If they can't solve it within the next 10yrs, their economy is screwed. In the Philippines, we dont have this problem

* 80% of Filipinos can understand basic English. That's a HUGE number for a non-Western country. It's sad that we failed to capitalize this incredible asset. Although this does not mean that all those 80% are proficient or good. The 80% are just people who understand basic English. Still, that's a big number 

Now, here's some bad statistics. With how poorly run this country is, there are so many, but i'll just focus on  a few. Maybe we can talk about the others on another post, but for now i'll focus on these. Anyway...

* 64% of our population is dependent, and that's a LOT. This means the Philippines is relying only on the 36% to carry this entire nation on their backs. In raw numbers, this means 41million Filipinos are expected to carry and feed 115million people. That's not good

* Only 31% of Filipinos above 25yrs old are highschool graduates

* Almost 1/5 of our entire population is located in these areas: Metro Manila, Metro Davao, Metro Cebu, and the Zamboanga urban area. Imagine that, 1/5 of our population are all jam-packed and crowded in just 4 urban areas

What can we draw from these data?

1) We have a lot of people in our ""prime years"" category, or those who are capable of either being employed, starting a business, or enrolling in a higher education. It's a great advantage.

2) However this advantage has become a disadvantage. A lot of Filipinos who are in the ""prime years"" are not employed or educated. Heck 80% of our adults did not even finish highschool

3) More than half of Filipinos are dependent on someone else's income

4) I know people will say more people = more traffic, but that's not automatically true. Tokyo is crowded but the transport system is so good that it doesnt even matter

5) In terms of population congestion, we have a lot of people but crowding should not be a problem if done with proper planning. We're all just jam-packed in a few cities while the other areas remain under-developed

Solutions we should consider:

- If you look at the data (both the good and bad), it looks like we need to open more jobs available to people who can be considered as **Skilled Workers**. It's good that we tell our youth to pursue being a professional (lawyer, engineer, doctor, accountant, etc). But we should also promote the importance of skilled workers in our economy

- **Skilled workers** are those who work on jobs that require training and certification, but not necessarily a college degree or diploma. Examples of skilled workers are construction workers, guards, drivers, call center agents, plumbers, factory workers, etc etc

- In other countries, skilled workers are very respected and called the ""backbone of the workforce"" but here in the Philippines they're considered as just lowly ""uneducated employees"". In other countries they are considered as an important cornerstone of the economy, I hope we can do that same here

- We talked about how a lot of Filipinos in the ""prime years"" are not productive, but the solution to this is to promote jobs available to skilled workers. Stop looking at skilled workers as uneducated or not important. Again in other countries, they are respected and they are seen as people who are crucial to the economy

- We should stop the mindset that if you're not a college graduate, you should be a businessman instead. You can also be a skilled worker.

- Of course, you need to pay them well. You also need to lower the requirements. We dont need a diploma for these jobs, and that's actually the point. We already have a hard time producing higschool graduates, if we cant also produce skilled workers then things will just get worse

- The government should start programs that will encourage adults to have **MORE children**. I know this sub doesnt like that statement, but hear me out. If the government can assure us that children will have a bright future in this country, I dont know why having more children is a bad thing

- Increase our salaries, give us benefits, and improve public services. If that happens it's almost a guarantee that our children will take care of this country in the future 

- Create more opportunities outside Metro Manila, Cebu, Davao, and Zamboanga area. So much of our population is jam-packed in just these 4 areas. Make jobs available outside these areas.

- 80% of our population speaks English and yet we havent thought of ways to use it for our advantage. We always teach students that English is the key to ""globalization"", but it's a shame that a lot of our neighbors who are very bad at English (like S.Korea and Japan) are more globalized than us. 

**TLDR:** Having a big population is not bad, it's only bad if all those people are not productive. A population that's both big and productive is good

our population can actually be an asset if we can take advantage of its potential

(i know...given the kind of government we have, that's a big **if**)

currently, our population sits at 115 million

it is projected to reach 116 million in 2024 or 2025. our population growth rate was actually decreasing steadily since the 1950's, and the rate only increased in 2020. that's almost 70yrs of continued decrease in population growth rate. 

note: decreasing growth rate from 1950-2020 does not mean decreasing in total population number, it means it's decreasing in ratio. decreased rate means our population was growing all those years, but it is growing at a very slow rate

basically from 1950-2020 we were growing very slowly, but from 2020 up until today we're growing faster

now, let's talk about numbers (and i'll keep it very simple)

here are some of our population stats that are actually good:

* the philippines have 115 million people, and 61% are in their ""prime years"" (age 15 to 64)

* according to demographers, ages 15 to 64 are called ""prime years"" because that's the age when people are productive. according to them, age 15 is where more people either (a) pursue higher education (college/university), (b) get employed at a job, or (c) start a business. all three of those paths are crucial for a country's growth. and age 64 is when most people are physically incapable of doing a lot of work

* the philippines having 61% in the prime years does not automatically mean all those people are in those 3 categories i listed on the point above, it just means 61% should be capable of doing those 3

* 61% isn't that good, but it's also not that bad...it's just okay. it's only bad because a lot of those in the 61% are not maximized to their potential (i will explain later)

* on the other hand, 34.6% of our population are considered ""children"" (age 0-14). this is actually good for the future of this country, because these children will be our ""work force"" in the future. there's a misconception that fewer births are good because there are fewer mouths to feed, which means less expenses. that is **not** true. fewer children means that there will be less people who will grow up to become part of the ""prime years"" in the future. and as we established in the points above, it's bad if the country has few people in the ""prime years"" category

* 34.6% of our population as children is good, the only issue here is if we can make sure these children actually grow up with a secure future (again, big **if** with this kind of government)

* to prove that this is actually a good thing, just look at japan. today, they have a good ""prime year"" number (64%), which is good right now. but their government is actually worried for the future of their country, because they only have 13% in the children category. and that's seriously bad, because only few people will grow up to be productive. if they can't solve it within the next 10yrs, their economy is screwed. in the philippines, we dont have this problem

* 80% of filipinos can understand basic english. that's a huge number for a non-western country. it's sad that we failed to capitalize this incredible asset. although this does not mean that all those 80% are proficient or good. the 80% are just people who understand basic english. still, that's a big number 

now, here's some bad statistics. with how poorly run this country is, there are so many, but i'll just focus on  a few. maybe we can talk about the others on another post, but for now i'll focus on these. anyway...

* 64% of our population is dependent, and that's a lot. this means the philippines is relying only on the 36% to carry this entire nation on their backs. in raw numbers, this means 41million filipinos are expected to carry and feed 115million people. that's not good

* only 31% of filipinos above 25yrs old are highschool graduates

* almost 1/5 of our entire population is located in these areas: metro manila, metro davao, metro cebu, and the zamboanga urban area. imagine that, 1/5 of our population are all jam-packed and crowded in just 4 urban areas

what can we draw from these data?

1) we have a lot of people in our ""prime years"" category, or those who are capable of either being employed, starting a business, or enrolling in a higher education. it's a great advantage.

2) however this advantage has become a disadvantage. a lot of filipinos who are in the ""prime years"" are not employed or educated. heck 80% of our adults did not even finish highschool

3) more than half of filipinos are dependent on someone else's income

4) i know people will say more people = more traffic, but that's not automatically true. tokyo is crowded but the transport system is so good that it doesnt even matter

5) in terms of population congestion, we have a lot of people but crowding should not be a problem if done with proper planning. we're all just jam-packed in a few cities while the other areas remain under-developed

solutions we should consider:

- if you look at the data (both the good and bad), it looks like we need to open more jobs available to people who can be considered as **skilled workers**. it's good that we tell our youth to pursue being a professional (lawyer, engineer, doctor, accountant, etc). but we should also promote the importance of skilled workers in our economy

- **skilled workers** are those who work on jobs that require training and certification, but not necessarily a college degree or diploma. examples of skilled workers are construction workers, guards, drivers, call center agents, plumbers, factory workers, etc etc

- in other countries, skilled workers are very respected and called the ""backbone of the workforce"" but here in the philippines they're considered as just lowly ""uneducated employees"". in other countries they are considered as an important cornerstone of the economy, i hope we can do that same here

- we talked about how a lot of filipinos in the ""prime years"" are not productive, but the solution to this is to promote jobs available to skilled workers. stop looking at skilled workers as uneducated or not important. again in other countries, they are respected and they are seen as people who are crucial to the economy

- create more opportunities outside metro manila, cebu, davao, and zamboanga area. so much of our population is jam-packed in just these 4 areas. make jobs available outside these areas.

1kd3yw2,Philippines,"Planning early retirement in the Philippines: Cebu, Iloilo or Baguio?","Hi everyone, I’m a 40-year-old Italian guy planning to retire early in the Philippines within a couple of years. I’m done with Italy’s high taxes and certainly don't want to work until 70. I see Asia—especially the Philippines—as the best fit for me (English widely spoken, low cost of living, Catholic culture, safe, no illegal immigration).

I’ll visit next winter to scout cities before looking to move permanently (or as long as visas allow!) after my niece finishes high school and goes to college abroad (I have been a father figure to her since her dad, my sister's husband, died suddenly about 5 years ago). I won't be able to keep my current job working remotely, so my income will come from rental properties in Italy—about €3000/month after taxes. I would like to live comfortably on €1000-1500/month. My priorities:

* Walkability: A base where I can walk (15-20 min) to hotspots (restaurants, supermarkets, malls, main streets). Comfort over adventure right now.
* Running/Workout Spots: I’m lazy at heart but active physically. Scenic areas for running, parks with free equipment like pull-up bars.
* Social Life: Bars, pubs, pickup basketball (can I play center at 6'1?), nightlife, and a foreigner-friendly dating scene.
* Looking for an affordable condo/studio (€500 per month?) in a modern, well-maintained area
* Costs: Rent, food, and extras within €1000-1500 per month (under 1000 would be awesome 😂)

After some research, I’ve narrowed it down to three cities with pros and cons:

* Cebu (IT Park):
   * Pros: Great walkability in IT Park, modern infrastructure, airport nearby, large dating pool.
   * Cons: Bigger city, more chaos, more expats, no coastal, river or lake vibes, risk of staying in an IT Park bubble.
* Iloilo (Mandurriao):
   * Pros: Smaller, authentic, fewer expats, cultural vibe, Iloilo Esplanade.
   * Cons: Fewer events, less modern, limited nightlife.
* Baguio (Session Road):
   * Pros: Cool climate, mountain aesthetic, Burnham Park, low costs.
   * Cons: Rainy season looks brutal

Nothing’s set in stone, and I’ll get a clearer picture when I visit. In the meantime, I’d love to hear opinions, suggestions and experiences from both expats and locals.

1izt8rc,Philippines,What is up with the Shaming here in PH?,"
Hello everyone,

I am an American born Filipino. I grew up in the states, I’ve lived in the states my entire life, and obviously, my passport is an American one.

Throughout my childhood, I was surrounded by English speakers. As a result, my family decided not to teach me their native language, Bisayan, or their second, Tagalog.

But, I also visit my distant relatives in Cebu once every three years. And before I continue, let me lay down a few pieces of context.

-I am HALF Filipino. I am actually Half Filipino and Half Pacific Islander. 

-In my local community (in the States) I am the only Filipino that doesn’t know how to read, speak, or write Tagalog.

- I am not following a traditional educational course (Elementary-Highschool) I dropped out, but am studying to become an Orthopedic Surgeon. 

-My life in the States is actually a below average quality compared to my fellow Statesmen. I am around the lower-middle class where I am able to afford necessities and chip in on rent/bills, but struggle enough to only afford the bare minimum with almost zero to little luxury in my life. (This is a big one to me, Id say.)


Every time I have visited Cebu, the locals, and my relatives, usually tend to nit pick or criticize, essentially, my life. 

For example, when I dropped out of highschool to pursue my GED instead. My relatives, not bothering to hide their disappointment, quickly berated me when I dropped the news. 

Before coming to the decision of dropping out, I made sure to talk with my school counselors, and the colleges I wanted to attend. I have been told numerous times that either a GED or Highschool Diploma will get me into a decent College and Medical School for my ambitions. I also simply just didn’t thrive in Highschool, as I was a loner, and didn’t agree with the education system in America. It just wasn’t a good fit for me.

My main issue wasn’t their critique, it was the fact that they all seemingly joined in, on some sort of thirst, to humiliate me. 

I am not sure if it is also due to the fact that I’m American. Again, I don’t understand Tagalog or Bisaya. But I am lucky enough to have had a cousin translate what my aunties and uncles would say. One time, he had told me that they do not even refer to me by my name, and instead, during conversations about me, refer to me as, “American” or, “Westerner”, or “Foreigner”. 

I feel that that gesture has alienated me from engaging with my local community in Cebu. My family is well known in their neighborhood, and I have met plenty of people that knew everything about me before I even got to meet them.  

I would seemingly be having a conversation with a local or relative, and  they would bring up the States. I have caught onto their “jealousy” multiple times, it is usually a quick snark of “You live in the States! Your life must be so easy compared to our struggles here”. However, that is not true. And as I have mentioned before, I actually struggle to live in the States. I am in no way more privileged or living an easier life.


Now, I am sure that this is really just a personal experience. But I feel that this one has been the most hurtful of them all. My uncles and cousins would “joke” about me not being a real Filipino. Particularly because I am only half. They would sometimes call me “impure” or say that my blood has been tainted. They would even go far as to harshly describe my Pacific Islander culture as a culture of “lazy drunkards with no sense of responsibility.” However, I would also go on to say that I’ve witnessed more of that kind of lazy-drunk culture in Philippines rather than when I visited my Islander relatives.

I would love to list down more personal experiences, but this post is already long enough. Essentially, all my visits in the PH have been, unfortunately toxic and negative. And it is not just me alone, I have had other American born Filipino friends come to me and talk about how negative their trip was in Manila, Quezon City, Illocos Nortes, and other areas in Philippines. Each have faced discrimination for being born in America. 

Why is there a big culture of shame here? As a so called “Westerner” I’ve had my fair share of being bullied in the States. But I have never had my own ethnicity, culture, and my very own person being constantly insulted and put down.

1h0temh,Philippines,Someone needs to study the comments section of SunStar Cebu's news post!,"I studied Mass Communication and Journalism in college, and I’ve always been fascinated by how society consumes news. Today, I stumbled upon the comments section of SunStar Cebu’s post, and I found it incredibly fascinating.

Here’s some context: SunStar Cebu posted a story about a flowchart that Senator Risa Hontiveros had originally shared on her social media. The flowchart, which is essentially an organizational chart or “matrix,” claims to show individuals allegedly tied to POGOs. Among those named in the matrix is former President Rodrigo Duterte, which naturally stirred some strong reactions. SunStar didn’t just write about the matrix—they only re-uploaded the image from Hontiveros’ post, effectively framing it as news and sparking a wave of commentary.

What's so interesting about this post is not the content of the matrix itself—it was how people reacted to it. If you scroll through the comments, you’ll find a mix of sarcasm and outright hostility. Comments like:

* “Hoy SunStar, pamisik mo Christmas bonus ninyo oy!”
* “No. 1 na c SunStar ani ehehe.”
* “Nice classroom organizational chart… :D”
* “Nagka wala buot najod ning uban sa gobyerno, grabeha najod maka pang-daut, may pa matrix matrix pang boeng.”
* “SOLID DU30 PARIN .”
* Hello! How's PHILHEALTH in the Phi?
* Panakip butas ni Niya sa iyang wrong turn sa SENATE, hahaha bagsak sa research!"", ""SOLID DU30 PARIN""
* Nagsalita ang Phil Health Queen
* wa lage nmo gi apil imong ngan diha mam human rights Risa H... ikaw raman nka kuwang dha.. twon oi..""

What’s interesting is that almost none of these comments actually engage with the matrix itself. There’s no attempt to analyze the content, evaluate the claims, or even consider the implications. Instead, the comments are focused on dismissing the news entirely or mocking both Hontiveros and SunStar Cebu. A few even dig up unrelated controversies, like PhilHealth issues linked to Hontiveros, as a way to discredit her entirely.

This kind of reaction raises some really fascinating questions for me about how people engage with political news on social media. A lot of what’s happening in these comments isn’t about the matrix at all! It’s about loyalty, mistrust, and the way people use humor and sarcasm to avoid deeper engagement.

For example, many of the commenters are clearly pro-Duterte and see the matrix as a baseless attack on him. Instead of considering the possibility of its validity, they immediately go into defense mode, accusing SunStar of bias or insinuating that the story was paid for. Comments like “Pila may gi bayad sa mga bangag nimu” (How much were your addicts paid?) reflect a deep distrust of news media.

Then there’s the use of sarcasm. Comments like “Nice classroom organizational chart” or “pamisik mo Christmas bonus ninyo oy” make light of the situation, almost as if to say, “This isn’t worth taking seriously.” It’s a common way people deflect from heavy topics online. By turning them into jokes or memes. But it also stops the conversation from going anywhere meaningful. :(

Another thing I noticed is how partisan loyalty completely dominates the discussion. The overwhelming support for Duterte in these comments isn’t surprising, but it’s fascinating to see how quickly any criticism of him is dismissed as malicious or unfounded. This kind of tribalism creates an “us vs. them” dynamic, where the goal isn’t to debate ideas but to defend your side at all costs. Even the local news outlet SunStar, whose only job is to relay information to the masses, wasn’t spared from the hostility. Instead of seeing the report as neutral or informative, people attacked it as biased or agenda-driven.

So what does all of this tell us? It’s a snapshot of how deeply polarized we’ve become, not just in terms of political loyalties but in the way we interact with information. People aren’t engaging with the facts or even debating the issue—they’re reacting emotionally, drawing from past grievances (like PhilHealth), and leaning on sarcasm or hostility to shut down the conversation entirely. Social media, instead of fostering discussion, often becomes a battleground where the loudest voices drown out any attempt at critical thought.

It’s a messy, chaotic phenomenon, but it’s also incredibly revealing. The SunStar Cebu comments aren’t just about a flowchart or even about Risa Hontiveros—they’re a window into how Filipinos are navigating (or not navigating) political discourse in the digital age. It kinda makes me sad. Rant done.","someone needs to study the comments section of sunstar cebu's news post! i studied mass communication and journalism in college, and i’ve always been fascinated by how society consumes news. today, i stumbled upon the comments section of sunstar cebu’s post, and i found it incredibly fascinating.

1f37040,Philippines,KAREN working in the (LGU),"Hello, I'm a college student who just moved to Cebu to live with my lola. I live near the palengke, and there are vendors outside my house trying to make a living by selling fish, vegetables, and other goods. There’s a particular lady who works in the local government unit (LGU) that I'll refer to as KAREN.

Here's some context about Karen she lives right next to our house. She is a typical LGU worker who demands ""respect,"" which is hard to give because of her arrogant attitude. She works in the mayor's office, so she holds a significant position, and with that comes a big ego.
Karen frequently harasses the local vendors. For instance, there was a time when she kicked a fish vendors bucket because it was blocking her path, claiming that it's illegal to sell on the pavement. While she may have had a point about the legality, it doesn't give her the right to kick someone's hanap-buhay. This isn't the only  incident. she often harasses small businesses about their permits, saying they have to pay big-fees. However, if they give her a little bit of MONIEY, she'll process the permit at a lower price. So, not only is she arrogant, but she's also corrupt.

For your guys information, my family and I haven't been harassed by Karen. I was just upset by what I saw happening to others. After speaking with the vendors, I felt saddened by the situation. it soo saddened to see someone in a high government position easily harass people who aren't on the same level as her.

What can I do to stop Karen?

AND ALSO, she has another job working as a manager at a gas station, which is a clear violation of the Civil Service Commission (CSC) rules. Her current job position in the (LGU) is also unrelated to her college degree.

18sypxr,Philippines,Cebuanos are unnecessarily hostile when it comes to Tagalog,"Okay before I start I have to say na I'm not stereotyping all Cebuanos/Bisaya, I'm just venting about some really annoying things I've noticed from a few Cebuanos when it comes to speaking Tagalog. I can understand if some Cebuanos find it difficult to speak Tagalog but to expect Tagalogs and non-Cebuanos to speak in Cebuano when in Cebu is crazy. Cebuano isn't taught in all parts of the country while Tagalog is. Everyone can speak Tagalog with varying degrees of fluency which isn't the same for Cebuano. I saw a TikTok of a Tagalog guy in SM Seaside speaking in his language while complimenting the place. If I were Cebuano, I would be really touched that this Tagalog guy is appreciating our city. But no, the majority of the comments in that video were from pretty hostile people saying that they should adjust when in Cebu and speak in Cebuano and to definitely not speak in Tagalog.

The TALA was developed by researchers, students, and their mentors from St. Cecilia’s College Cebu, with the Philippine Space Agency and the Philippine Air Force providing assistance and fueling the rocket.

If empowered students can do something like this, I wonder what can be done by specific government agencies which have the resources, manpower and access to technology.

Let this be an example of the need for motivation for the Philippines to start doing more in science, technology, defense and manufacturing.

I told my mom about this and she said that I need to work first since we won't be to eat anything if I don't. Hence, I didnt enrol for the school year. 

My mom wants me to give her 3k allowance plus 1.5k for the rent of her room if I will go to Cebu very 15th and 30th of the month. I don't know if I will able to do that.

14lwvtx,Philippines,My Experience(so far) with this country's abusive Educational System.,"Good day, I'm a 1st-year irregular student taking an Engineering Course in Cebu with a scholarship on my shoulder, and I want to express my grievances and anger in this subreddit.

Due to my being an irregular student, I was assigned an Integral Calculus class in the summer, which I thought was fine at first. For those who know Integral Calculus or Calculus 2, you would know how difficult it is to grasp and understand even the fundamentals of it.

However, with only 1 and 1/2 months (6-7 weeks), we were tasked with understanding everything about Integral Calculus; which is, in my opinion, just impossible to do. Not only were we given a gigantic amount of expectation to learn a subject that could as well take a lifetime to understand, but we were also shamed and—borderline, verbally abused for not getting it right with our first 2-3 quizzes.

Now, just miles away from getting a failing grade, I am currently at my lowest point because of my scholarship. Some of my professors saw promise in me, and because of that, I was lucky enough to hold a position within the student organization (not bragging) but losing this scholarship could mean losing my only means of financial support, and this might as well be the end of my college journey.

I feel like I, and my future, are at the mercy of this professor, who is not afraid to give students a failing grade. A single decision of his will lead me down a harder path in life. Please, pray for me.

lvc98o,Philippines,Where do you buy electronics and other things?,"Hi guys,

I am an American who was visiting the Philippines back in 2019 for about 3 weeks. I recently gained my dual citizenship and looking forward to probably living in Cebu City after college.

Coming from the USA, I do my shopping pretty much online. I mainly shop on Amazon for electronics and other goods like home appliances. This allows me to not really leave my home except to buy groceries and such.

As far as I can tell when I visited the Philippines, most people go to the malls to buy their stuff. Is there a Philippine version of Amazon that offers just as much items as Amazon has on their website or is the mall the best option to shop for electronics and other things.

I would love to know. Thanks.","where do you buy electronics and other things? hi guys,

xoggi0,Philippines,Monster Partner: Philippines (My own story concept for a Science Fantasy series about Filipino culture),"(Spoilers)

**Premise:**
Set in the years 2009 to 2026, in the Philippines of a savage alternate timeline where humanity coexists with iconic creatures from folklores around the world and only the strongest and most adaptable creatures would survive, my fan fiction *Monster Girlfriend PH* (also known as *Monster Partner PH* in the U.S) could be a Filipino/American limited series that follows the close and intimate relationship between a man and a monster, who travel together across the entirety of the Philippines. As they voyage through the Archipelago to seek answers, and getting involved in many dangerous situations, they find their love and care to be powerful enough to provide the safety of the Filipino people and their allies from other vicious monsters, invasive threats, and the inevitable return of a vengeful ancient entity.

Juan: *""I'm not a little boy anymore... I'm a big strong man now, a warrior.""*

Valerie: *""I know you are... however, deep inside your armor, you really are just a sad and vulnerable child. All you ever need is love and care. Let me help you.""*

| **Juan R. El Fidèles** | -  the serious, cautious, cunning and quiet, yet kind, creative, perserverant, loving, caring and loyal main protagonist of the series and the human boyfriend (and eventually husband) of Valerie, a female aswang who is also his childhood friend and crush. As a mixed-martial artist from the barangay of Patrocinio, Claveria, Misamis Oriental, he is a fearless and determined warrior of unlikely Austronesian and European descent, and is experienced in Asymmetrical warfare, mixed-martial arts and sharpshooting skills. He is a **""Monster Hunter""** or a **""Battle-Hardened Human""**, a naturally enchanced human being caused by a rare evolutionary defense mechanism of the *'Homo sapiens'* of his universe in response to hard work and years of combat experience fighting monsters, which causes their bodies to dramatically change and revert back to a more primal stage, growing bigger, stronger, faster, smarter, tougher, healthier, more aggressive, and possess a better animal flight zone than ordinary human beings in order to match the ferocity of dangerous monsters and slay them, literally embodying the quote of *“Whoever fights monsters should see to it that in the process he does not become a monster”* by **Friedrich Nietzsche** as a result. Due to his ADHD type 1, combined with PTSD from his tragic childhood involving monsters, and his strange decision to live alone in his deceased parent's Cottage in the mountains at the age of fifteen to become strong and independent, he became an outcast of Filipino society for being different, only his childhood friend, Valerie S. Arévalo, and the local elderly people like his deceased WWII/Korean War veteran grandfather trusted him and believe him to be a good boy, while he is feared and shunned by young people around his age for being different and violent, especially when he is rumoured by them as a brutal monster slayer who uses inhumane hunting methods and deadly ammunition types to cause fear and suffering to the more common monsters like sigbin and aswang, and also the fact that he doesn't care about fitting in Filipino society as he is aware of their flaws and lies due to his access to the Internet where he does actual research and they hate him for telling the truth, but he didn't care what society thinks because he was determined to do what he wants without the need for validation. He used to distrust monsters, and even brutally killed and tortured the same aswang group who had devoured his parents years prior, despite his grandfather warning to only use everything he had thought him for defense before his death, but eventually learned from Valerie that they too are tragic beings that require their help. So after graduating Highschool and College together with her after the Mindanao chapter, he accompanies Valerie in her travel across the four islands Philippines to solve the ancient mystery behind their origins. Although Juan possesses size, strength, intelligence, creativity, versatility, independence, and his fierce determination and cunning nature as a man and a warrior, his ADHD makes him forgetful about things he's not really interested in and gets easily distracted most of the time, and he is revealed to be an awkward and anxious person who isn't used to how society works as he had spent much of his childhood and adolescent years training in isolation with his veteran grandfather's teachings, so he could only use his primal instincts more often than being a civilised person, such as deeming other men his age as ""rival bachelors"" and intimidating those who tries to flirt on Valerie, or observing every area he walks by to analyze any possible threat to his and Valerie's lives. Physically, he lacks Valerie's speed and agility in combat, and mentally, he doesn't compare to her maturity, wisdom, knowledge, concentration, and leadership skills allowed her to live as a normal person, but she helps him to learn new things about the humanity and the world around them during their journey so he would eventually become a better person, and allow him to take the lead in certain situations. In combat, he serves as a long-ranged support for Valerie, with the use of his foreign mixed martial arts, stealth, salvaged modern firearms and holy anti-magic sword and spear.



| **Valerie E. Arévalo** | - the quirky and cheerful, yet selfless, stoic and fiercely loyal deurotagonist and the mascot of the series, she is the titular Monster Partner (and later wife) of Juan, as she is an **'Aswang'**, one of the many Demon types, humans corrupted by the dark magic of an unknown ancient evil. She is a member of a rich family from Balamban, Cebu in Central Visayas. She had moved alongside her guardians to the barangay of Poblacion in Claveria, Misamis Oriental in Mindanao for true reasons yet to be revealed, although she simply claims that she is the only aswang in her family and was sent by her parents to a more rural location to allow her to grow up safely, undetected by the eyes of **""The Armed Forces of The Philippines""** who would deem her as a threat to human society and from the violent **""Monster Hunters""** who would hunt and kill monsters like her for sport, glory, or easy money. She is Juan's childhood friend, whom she met while he and his cousins were fishing on a river just a year after the death of his parents, and grew up together. But when he eventually finds out that she is an aswang, he attempted to kill her due to his PTSD and his instinct to slay monsters, but she easily defeats him due to her being stronger and more experienced in combat compared to the creatures that Juan had slain before the start of the series. After settling ther issues and giving Juan a (painful) reality check, they rekindle their friendship, and Valerie convinces Juan to help others by joining her in their voyage across the Philippines to find out the mysteries behind the monsters, and to find a way for her to become human to reunite with her family (and potentially marry Juan should he accept her). She usually takes the lead and initiative over Juan due to her greater wisdom and maturity, alongside her superior athletic prowess and martial art discipline, social & multilingual skills, and wealth. However, she still struggles with her flaws which are opposites to Juan, most notably her dependence on her family's fortune compared to Juan who can survive and kill most monsters on his own in the rainforest and aquatic environments even with just sticks and stones, her inability to eat anything other than the flesh and life force of living creatures which saddens her every time she looks as Juan eats typical Filipino cuisines, and her insecurities about her looks without makeup compared to other women and doubting that Juan would ever fall in love with her, getting moments of violent tendencies as a result to the point where even the brave Juan would get nervous around her, making him regret some of his own actions once Valerie snaps, and once secretly referred to her as a ""Yandere anime girl"" while discussing with a classmate who was fond of Japanese anime during their College years. But as Juan slowly develops throughout their journey, he began to understood their similar problems together and regularly helps Valerie to better their relationship and teamwork in helping their fellow Filipino people throughout their journey. In combat and other emergencies, she serves as the main close-combat attacker and medical support, who assists Juan using her archery skills with bows and crossbows, her own bolos, and her Aswang abilities, which consists of her razor sharp teeth, claws, and dark energy manipulation for battle. Valerie drives an uplifted and heavily modified **2008 Toyota Land Cruiser V8** she nicknamed ""Ken"" for her and Juan to travel throughout the harsh geography of the Philippines and carry medical and utility supplies for aiding others.

nowmic,Philippines,Engineering to Medicine,"Hi there, I graduated in Engineering last July 2020 and now reviewing for the coming board exam (lagi kasing naka-cancel lol). I'm so distracted while reviewing because I really want to go to med school and totally abandon the engineering field.

I realized back when I was a 3rd year student that engineering is not for me but I wasn't able to let it go kasi nagshift na rin ako dati. Now that I graduated,  I still don't have the peace of mind to be on that field. 

Yung interest ko talaga ay sa medicine and life science since I was a kid but when I was in high school, feeling ko imposible siya because of my socio-economic status. Sobrang hirap kami financially so hindi ko na pinilit. Ang mali ko lang, hindi ako kumuha ng premed course and tried to push for it. 😭

I don't have a source of income but I really want to go to medicine. I'm planning to apply to DOH partner schools for scholarship after ko mag-NMAT but I'm afraid na baka hindi ako matanggap kasi hindi rin naman matataas yung grades ko nung college. :(

Any tips and advise?

1fk6ncu,Philippines,Political Dynasties: The Stationary Mafia that Rules the Philippines,"Bakit tila naging sentro ng political dynasties ang Pilipinas sa kabila ng malinaw na probisyon sa ating Saligang Batas na nagbabawal dito? Kapangyarihan at kayamanan—iyan ang mga dahilan kung bakit patuloy ang paglago ng mga dinastiyang ito. Sa ating bansa, pulitika ang pinakamabilis na daan para sa pagpapayaman at pagpapatatag ng kontrol sa ekonomiya at lipunan. Habang ang ibang propesyon tulad ng pagiging abogado, doktor, o inhinyero ay nangangailangan ng diploma, lisensya, at taon-taong pagsasanay, sa pulitika, walang kinakailangang kwalipikasyon. Sapat na ang pagkakaroon ng balat-kalabaw o pagiging insensitive sa pangungutya at kritisismo.

Ang Article II, Section 26 ng 1987 Philippine Constitution ay malinaw na ipinagbabawal ang political dynasties: ""The State shall guarantee equal access to opportunities for public service, and prohibit political dynasties as may be defined by law."" Ngunit nasaan ang batas na magpapatupad nito? Sa loob ng maraming taon, walang nais na ipasa ang batas dahil ang mga miyembro ng Kongreso ay mga benepisyaryo ng mga dinastiyang ito. Hindi nila gagawing ipasa ang batas na ito dahil para na nilang pinirmahan ang kanilang sariling harakiri—isang pagtapos sa kanilang mga dinastiya.

Sa ilalim ng sistemang ito, ang ating mga pulitiko ay tila hindi mga lingkod-bayan kundi mga stationary bandits—mga naghahari sa kanilang mga teritoryo, kumukuha ng yaman, at walang habas na lumalabag sa ating Konstitusyon. Sila ang mga modernong Mafia, mga gluttons for power and privilege na kumokontrol sa pulitika, ekonomiya, militar, at maging mga ilegal na aktibidad tulad ng smuggling at ilegal na sugal. Ang paglikha ng mga dinastiyang ito ay nagiging open defiance sa ating Konstitusyon at nagpapahina sa rule of law.

Isang malinaw na halimbawa ng oligarkiya sa ating bansa ang Aquino-Cojuangco family na nagmamay-ari ng Hacienda Luisita—isang lupain na sinasabing mas malaki pa kaysa sa Maynila at Makati na pinagsama. Sa kabila ng mga reporma sa lupa, nananatili sa kanilang kontrol ang malawak na lupain.

Ang Marcos family naman, na bumalik sa kapangyarihan matapos ang mga taon ng pagiging mga bilyonaryo mula sa mga pinaghihinalaang kinurakot sa kaban ng bayan, ay isa pang patunay ng walang tigil na dominasyon ng mga dinastiyang ito. Kasama rin dito ang Estrada family sa San Juan at Maynila, ang Duterte dynasty sa Davao, at iba pang lokal na dinastiya tulad ng Revilla sa Cavite, Garcia sa Cebu, Binay sa Makati, Ampatuan sa Maguindanao, at Singson sa Ilocos Sur.

Ayon sa isang pag-aaral ng Ateneo School of Government, ilan sa mga pinakamahihirap na probinsya ng bansa ay nasa ilalim ng mga dinastiyang ito: Lanao del Sur, Maguindanao, Sulu, Zamboanga del Norte, Eastern Samar, at Northern Samar. Sa mga lugar na ito, ang mga political dynasty ay hindi lamang nagpapanatili ng kapangyarihan kundi nagsisilbing hadlang sa pag-unlad ng mga rehiyon, na siyang nagreresulta sa matinding kahirapan at kawalang oportunidad. Ang pag-aaral ay nagpapatunay na ang pinakamahihirap na lugar sa Pilipinas ay kalimitang kontrolado ng mga fat dynasties, mga pamilyang hindi lamang iisa ang miyembrong nasa kapangyarihan kundi iba't ibang sangay ng gobyerno sa iisang lugar.

Ang probisyon sa ating Konstitusyon laban sa political dynasties ay hindi isang rekomendasyon lamang. Ito ay isang batayang prinsipyo na dapat ipatupad ng literal. Ngunit bakit nga ba hindi ito naisasabatas? Dahil ang mga nasa Kongreso mismo ang bumubuo ng mga dinastiya—mula sa mga pamilya tulad ng Marcos, Duterte, Aquino-Cojuangco, at Estrada. Hindi nila nais ipasa ang isang batas na magiging laban sa kanilang sariling interes.

Ayon sa ating Konstitusyon, political dynasties are inherently undemocratic dahil sa kakayahan nilang kontrolin hindi lamang ang kapangyarihan kundi maging ang mga institusyon ng militar, pulisya, at mga ilegal na aktibidad. Kaya’t hindi nakakapagtaka na hanggang ngayon ay hindi naipapasa ang batas na magtatapos sa kanilang pamamayagpag.

Ang mga lugar na nasa ilalim ng kontrol ng political dynasties ay hindi umaasenso. Bakit nga ba ganito? Dahil ang kapangyarihan ay naiipon lamang sa iilang tao. Hindi ito ipinapasa sa mga mas karapat-dapat at mas maraming Pilipino. Isipin mo, sino ang may tiyansang manalo sa eleksyon kung kalaban mo ang mga pamilyang may mga hawak ng milyon-milyong pondo at malalaking koneksyon? Para sa mga ordinaryong Pilipino, lalo na sa mga nagmula sa mahihirap na sektor, wala silang laban.

Sa ilalim ng political dynasty, nagiging monarkiya ang ating gobyerno, kung saan ang kapangyarihan ay ipinapasa mula ama hanggang anak, mula sa kapatid hanggang apo. Ito ba ang demokrasya? Is this the Philippines that we envisioned when we fought for freedom and equality? Political dynasty is anathema in a democracy, dahil wala itong lugar sa isang sistema na dapat ay pantay ang oportunidad para sa lahat.

Mga kababayan, gising na! Hindi na tayo dapat magpadaig sa mga pamilyang ito. Habang patuloy tayong bumoboto para sa kanila, patuloy din silang maghahari-harian at kikitain ang yaman ng bayan. Kung tunay tayong nagnanais ng pagbabago, dapat nating itigil ang pagbibigay ng kapangyarihan sa mga dinastiya.

You want change, but you keep voting for dynasties? How foolish.

Ang tunay na pagbabago ay magsisimula lamang kung ibibigay natin ang pagkakataon sa mga bagong lider—mga lider na hindi bahagi ng mga oligarchy na ito, mga lider na tunay na may malasakit at pagmamahal sa bayan. Hindi lang sa salita, kundi sa gawa.

Ang political dynasty ay isang insulto sa bawat Pilipino na nangangarap ng mas maayos na kinabukasan. Ipaglaban natin ang ating karapatan. Igalang natin ang ating Saligang Batas.

The Constitution is supreme. And the will of the people must prevail.

#IbaNaman!","political dynasties: the stationary mafia that rules the philippines bakit tila naging sentro ng political dynasties ang pilipinas sa kabila ng malinaw na probisyon sa ating saligang batas na nagbabawal dito? kapangyarihan at kayamanan—iyan ang mga dahilan kung bakit patuloy ang paglago ng mga dinastiyang ito. sa ating bansa, pulitika ang pinakamabilis na daan para sa pagpapayaman at pagpapatatag ng kontrol sa ekonomiya at lipunan. habang ang ibang propesyon tulad ng pagiging abogado, doktor, o inhinyero ay nangangailangan ng diploma, lisensya, at taon-taong pagsasanay, sa pulitika, walang kinakailangang kwalipikasyon. sapat na ang pagkakaroon ng balat-kalabaw o pagiging insensitive sa pangungutya at kritisismo.

ang article ii, section 26 ng 1987 philippine constitution ay malinaw na ipinagbabawal ang political dynasties: ""the state shall guarantee equal access to opportunities for public service, and prohibit political dynasties as may be defined by law."" ngunit nasaan ang batas na magpapatupad nito? sa loob ng maraming taon, walang nais na ipasa ang batas dahil ang mga miyembro ng kongreso ay mga benepisyaryo ng mga dinastiyang ito. hindi nila gagawing ipasa ang batas na ito dahil para na nilang pinirmahan ang kanilang sariling harakiri—isang pagtapos sa kanilang mga dinastiya.

sa ilalim ng sistemang ito, ang ating mga pulitiko ay tila hindi mga lingkod-bayan kundi mga stationary bandits—mga naghahari sa kanilang mga teritoryo, kumukuha ng yaman, at walang habas na lumalabag sa ating konstitusyon. sila ang mga modernong mafia, mga gluttons for power and privilege na kumokontrol sa pulitika, ekonomiya, militar, at maging mga ilegal na aktibidad tulad ng smuggling at ilegal na sugal. ang paglikha ng mga dinastiyang ito ay nagiging open defiance sa ating konstitusyon at nagpapahina sa rule of law.

isang malinaw na halimbawa ng oligarkiya sa ating bansa ang aquino-cojuangco family na nagmamay-ari ng hacienda luisita—isang lupain na sinasabing mas malaki pa kaysa sa maynila at makati na pinagsama. sa kabila ng mga reporma sa lupa, nananatili sa kanilang kontrol ang malawak na lupain.

ang marcos family naman, na bumalik sa kapangyarihan matapos ang mga taon ng pagiging mga bilyonaryo mula sa mga pinaghihinalaang kinurakot sa kaban ng bayan, ay isa pang patunay ng walang tigil na dominasyon ng mga dinastiyang ito. kasama rin dito ang estrada family sa san juan at maynila, ang duterte dynasty sa davao, at iba pang lokal na dinastiya tulad ng revilla sa cavite, garcia sa cebu, binay sa makati, ampatuan sa maguindanao, at singson sa ilocos sur.

ayon sa isang pag-aaral ng ateneo school of government, ilan sa mga pinakamahihirap na probinsya ng bansa ay nasa ilalim ng mga dinastiyang ito: lanao del sur, maguindanao, sulu, zamboanga del norte, eastern samar, at northern samar. sa mga lugar na ito, ang mga political dynasty ay hindi lamang nagpapanatili ng kapangyarihan kundi nagsisilbing hadlang sa pag-unlad ng mga rehiyon, na siyang nagreresulta sa matinding kahirapan at kawalang oportunidad. ang pag-aaral ay nagpapatunay na ang pinakamahihirap na lugar sa pilipinas ay kalimitang kontrolado ng mga fat dynasties, mga pamilyang hindi lamang iisa ang miyembrong nasa kapangyarihan kundi iba't ibang sangay ng gobyerno sa iisang lugar.

ang probisyon sa ating konstitusyon laban sa political dynasties ay hindi isang rekomendasyon lamang. ito ay isang batayang prinsipyo na dapat ipatupad ng literal. ngunit bakit nga ba hindi ito naisasabatas? dahil ang mga nasa kongreso mismo ang bumubuo ng mga dinastiya—mula sa mga pamilya tulad ng marcos, duterte, aquino-cojuangco, at estrada. hindi nila nais ipasa ang isang batas na magiging laban sa kanilang sariling interes.

ayon sa ating konstitusyon, political dynasties are inherently undemocratic dahil sa kakayahan nilang kontrolin hindi lamang ang kapangyarihan kundi maging ang mga institusyon ng militar, pulisya, at mga ilegal na aktibidad. kaya’t hindi nakakapagtaka na hanggang ngayon ay hindi naipapasa ang batas na magtatapos sa kanilang pamamayagpag.

ang mga lugar na nasa ilalim ng kontrol ng political dynasties ay hindi umaasenso. bakit nga ba ganito? dahil ang kapangyarihan ay naiipon lamang sa iilang tao. hindi ito ipinapasa sa mga mas karapat-dapat at mas maraming pilipino. isipin mo, sino ang may tiyansang manalo sa eleksyon kung kalaban mo ang mga pamilyang may mga hawak ng milyon-milyong pondo at malalaking koneksyon? para sa mga ordinaryong pilipino, lalo na sa mga nagmula sa mahihirap na sektor, wala silang laban.

1ieb6ai,Philippines,"Why the Philippines should become the offshore asylum processing center for deported Latin American immigrants, in exchange for signing a free trade agreement (FTA) with the US","It has been 10 days already since Donald Trump returned to the White House as President of the United States for the second time and we all know that geopolitics has suddenly changed within 10 days of Trump's second presidential term like threatening to grab Greenland from Denmark and the ongoing mass deportation of illegal immigrants to their countries of origin, particularly Latin American countries like Mexico and Venezuela. 

According to the 2019 American Community Survey, there were around 7,410,000 undocumented Latino immigrants in the United States, where deporting all of them back to their countries of origin is impractical and even if the Trump administration were to deport a tenth of them may already create resistance among Latin American countries like Colombia [\[1\]](https://cmsny.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Hispanic_undocumented.pdf). The Trump administration has revoked deportation protections for 600,000 Venezuelans, many of them fled Venezuela due to the decade-long economic depression under dictator Nicolas Maduro [\[2\]](https://apnews.com/article/immigration-border-security-venezuela-tps-noem-af43e2135ea588717669794288e5b6e6).

Due to the large number of illegal immigrants in the United States, it would be inevitable for the US government to find a third-party country as an offshore asylum processing center for millions of illegal immigrants that cannot be absorbed by their countries of origin anymore. I think the Philippines would be the ideal place for the United States government to be designated as the offshore detention center for deported immigrants, especially Latin Americans, from the United States, based on the British model where Rwanda became the offshore asylum processing center for those who want to enter the United Kingdom [\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rwanda_asylum_plan).

If ever our country gets designated as the offshore asylum processing center for those who want to enter the United States, the Philippine government should create policies or laws for those asylum seekers bound for the United States who may change their minds and decide to permanently settle in our country like granting them constitutional property ownership rights for businesses and real estate properties, permitting them to work in regulated professions like nursing and teaching, and so on. 

Hosting at least 100,000 Latin American asylum seekers who may decide to permanently settle in our country should become the deported mainland Chinese POGO workers' replacement, in order to mitigate the real estate price bubble burst in Metros Manila and Cebu, by employing them in the BPO industry through filling in vacant Spanish language bilingual positions that may not be filled in by local Filipinos or in the education sector as grade and high school Spanish language teachers. 

This is perhaps one of the most effective ways to build a base of Spanish-speaking Latin American expatriates in our country, as the counterweight to the English-speaking American expats and Mandarin-speaking Chinese POGO workers in our country. It is ironic that there are far more Spanish-speaking Latin American expats in Australia and Japan than in the Philippines these days (in Australia, it's mostly Chilean, while in Japan, Peruvian).

1fxz0l0,Philippines,Children of people from other provinces who moved to Manila for work in the 70's,"What good or bad experiences did you have growing up because of cultural differences?

My parents moved to Manila because of work back in the 70's. Both come from Bisaya backgrounds. I was born in late 80's and was raised in Manila but I really grew up heavily with Bisaya culture and with a Bisaya community although I went to a nearby school. It was weird because during classes its english, with friends its tagalog but at home its bisaya. In the end, I was never good at any of them. 😂 

Back then, I would make mistakes thinking some bisaya words are tagalog (much to my embarasament as a kid). I thought that people knew fruits like marang, suha, durian, etc. On rare and really big occasions, lechon would be flown from Cebu and be picked up at the airport. 😂 Yeah its different now because of technology  and internet.

I did have one big insecurity as a child for being Bisaya. I was called inday and translating that to tagalog probably should be like ""nene"". It's a term of endearment. It would've helped if I have a bisaya classmate but there was no one. So no one understood and sadly, i got teased and laughed at for being inday because of the ""katulong"" image. The narrative that bisaya people were country bumpkins was quite strong in the 90's. I hated it a lot and pushed to use my real name to hide where I came from. 

I grew up now and feel different. As an adult, I mostly identify myself with the bisaya culture I grew up with at my home. Now I'm wondering about other's experiences, not just for bisaya and how it was like.","children of people from other provinces who moved to manila for work in the 70's what good or bad experiences did you have growing up because of cultural differences?

Ano ang masasabi mo rito?,"Ang Republic Act 12027 o ang batas na nagpapahinto sa paggamit ng MOTHER TONGUE bilang medium of instruction mula Kindergarten hanggang ikatlong baitang (Grade 3).

Ayon sa naturang batas, ang medium of instruction ay ibabalik sa wikang Filipino at Ingles at ang mga rehiyonal na mga lenguage ay gagamitin lamang bilang gabay o pantulong sa pagtuturo.

Ngunit HINDI ipinaguutos ng batas ang pagpipigil ng paggamit ng MOTHER TONGUE sa pagtuturo o medium of instruction. Bagkus, ihahanay ito sa pangunahing pangangailangan ng Mother Tongue-based Multilingual Education in Monolingual Classes.

Ang prinsipyo ng Mother Tongue-based Multilingual Education in Monolingual Classes ay may mga pangunahing pangangailangan

* (1) ang paggamit ng opisyal na orthography o palábaybayan na inilathala ng Komisyon sa Wikang Filipino (KWF).
* (2) opisyal na bokabularyo na inilathala ng KWF tulad ng glosaryo, diksyunaryo, encyclopedia, o thesaurus.
* (3) literaturang base sa naturang lenguage at kultura tulad ng libro, retrato, o balarila (grammar).
* (4) gurong may kapasidad na makapagturo ng naturang Mother Tongue.

Sa kada tatlong taon pagkalipas ng pagsasabatas nitong naturang batas, magsasagawa ang Kagawaran ng Edukasyon (DepEd) ng review ng optional implementation ng MTB-MLE in Monolingual Classes. Sa magiging DepEd Report, titignan kung mayroong positibong teacher-learner assessment, o may progreso sa paglikha ng mga learning resources na nailathata sa Mother Tongue.

----------

SunStar Cebu: Jimenez highlighted challenges in implementing the mother-tongue policy due to Cebu’s diverse linguistic landscape. “Cebuano itself has many variations; if you travel to different areas in Cebu, some words differ significantly. This makes it difficult to standardize teaching materials that work across all communities,” he explained. 

He noted that while the mother tongue initially aimed to facilitate learning by using familiar language, its effectiveness has been limited in the Philippines due to varying dialects across regions. “Unlike in countries where one language is uniformly used, such as English, our situation makes the use of the mother tongue more complicated,” he added.

Despite this shift, Jimenez believes students will not struggle with the transition. “I don’t think students will have a hard time learning without the mother tongue. Many already understand Filipino and English,” he stated.

Rappler: ACT Teachers Representative France Castro, said that pushing for the bill was tantamount to punishing children for the DepEd’s shortcomings, and that the efforts of schools in implementing mother tongue in learning materials would go to waste.

**Pero ano nga ba ang say ng UNESCO tungkol sa paggamit ng Mother Tongue as Medium of Instruction?** 

Every year on 21 February, the world celebrates [International Mother Language Day](https://en.unesco.org/commemorations/motherlanguageday), which was established at the [initiative of Bangladesh](https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000120679.page=184) by UNESCO’s General Conference in 1999. The Day is an essential platform to promote the importance of cultural and linguistic diversity, and multilingualism for peaceful and sustainable societies.

Research shows that education in the mother tongue is a key factor for inclusion and quality learning, and it also improves learning outcomes and academic performance. This is crucial, especially in primary school to avoid knowledge gaps and increase the speed of learning and comprehension. And most importantly, multilingual education based on the mother tongue empowers all learners to fully take part in society. It fosters mutual understanding and respect for one another and helps preserve the wealth of cultural and traditional heritage that is embedded in every language around the world. 

However, there is still a long way to go before guaranteeing all learners their right to education in their mother language. In most countries, the majority of students are taught in a language other than their mother tongue, which compromises their ability to learn effectively. It is estimated that 40 % of the world’s population does not have access to an education in a language they speak or understand. There are about 7,000 languages spoken around the world today. But linguistic diversity is increasingly threatened as more and more languages disappear at an alarming rate. And when a language disappears, it takes with it an entire cultural and intellectual heritage.

1hcdaxg,Philippines,Is Mega World Mactan Newtown a good investment or not,"I need insights from condo unit owners, specially if you own a condo in mactan newtown. Me and my partner are looking for a rent to own property, we are from cebu. 

We are currently renting  and have been thinking of buying a property for us to live in for like 2-3years  and then have it rented after.

For now we can only afford the rent to own properties since our combined salary doesn’t meet the usual required salary for bank loans yet.

I’ve been to mactan newtown and fell inlove with the place. As they say it’s like the little BGC and found out that they have a flexible rent to own payment scheme on their condos. 

I feel like it’s going to be a good investment since theres a lot of development in the township, there are also foreigners living there because theres an english school plus it’s near the airport. You also have a free access to their beach if you’re a condo owner in the township. I believe renters also have free access to the beach.

Btw, we initially wanted to buy within the cebu city proper but we just cant afford it yet. We also have a furbaby so pet friendly condo is a must. 


Would love to know your thoughts about condo investment and how is it living in Mactan Newtown. Do you think it’s worth it?","is mega world mactan newtown a good investment or not i need insights from condo unit owners, specially if you own a condo in mactan newtown. me and my partner are looking for a rent to own property, we are from cebu. 

we are currently renting  and have been thinking of buying a property for us to live in for like 2-3years  and then have it rented after.

for now we can only afford the rent to own properties since our combined salary doesn’t meet the usual required salary for bank loans yet.

i’ve been to mactan newtown and fell inlove with the place. as they say it’s like the little bgc and found out that they have a flexible rent to own payment scheme on their condos. 

i feel like it’s going to be a good investment since theres a lot of development in the township, there are also foreigners living there because theres an english school plus it’s near the airport. you also have a free access to their beach if you’re a condo owner in the township. i believe renters also have free access to the beach.

btw, we initially wanted to buy within the cebu city proper but we just cant afford it yet. we also have a furbaby so pet friendly condo is a must.

1ejajxq,Philippines,Palpak ang Sports sa Pilipinas.,"Congrats kay Carlos Yulo sa Gold! We have more athletes who can win a medal, even gold.
Sorry na rin sa click bait na title. Kung naagaw ko atensyon mo, I hope you read some of my thought. Pasensya na rin at medj unorganize yung thoughts ko pero I've had these feelings since I was 12... More than a decade later and what I believe, now I know many of it are TRUE.

1. Fundamentally and systematically, we are bad in sports. 

What I mean by this is, from grassroots to the national teams, maraming magulo sa structure ng ating sports. Yung mismong structure. Bukod sa maraming kurakot at ginagamit ang sports para manglamang ng kapwa, eh hindi connected ang efforts natin sa sports. We rely on 1 person (Pacman, Kai Sotto, Hidilyn, Yulo, EJ) rather than properly, fundemantally, improving the overall system. Nagiging showbiz ba. Pero totoo na sa sports, you have the stars. But we really have to establish a PROGRAM, a SYSTEM. I will explain this more as I go on.

2. Support ALL sports.
Everytime na may nanalong sports tayo, we often criticize basketball and even volleyball. Kesyo dapat bawasan ng funding etc... Do you think, that our economy and 110M Filipinos CAN'T SUPPORT ALL SPORTS??? Hindi. I want everyone to look at Serbia, Australia, New Zealand and even our neighbors in SEA. Oo, lamang sila sa pera dahil mas maganda mga economy nila, pero Philippines is not poor. We just need a good system and honest, hardworking governing bodies to do their job. We also need to delegate enough resources to develop this.

HUWAG NIYO TANGGALIN ANG SUPPORT SA GILAS at ALAS. Huwag niyo rin i bash basketball. WE SHOULD AIM TO DOMINATE ALL SPORTS. So dito palang sana, magbago na ang mindset natin. We should have a winning mindset that we have to support all sports and that we have high but proper expectations for them (yung healthy, huwag toxic expectations). 

So sana, itigil na yung pag advocate na bawasan yung basketball or volleyball. What we shoudld be advocating is for more support sa iba, AT AYUSIN NG VBALL AT BASKETBALL YUNG ORGANIZATION NILA. More on this sa next point ko.

3. Sports is community based.

Dito papasok yung sinasabi ko sa #1. The example I have is our Philippine BASKETBALL Association. Para sa 2nd oldest pro league, napag iwanan na ng panahon.

Saan ka nakakita na archipelago (LuzViMinda) ang liga mo pero naka sentro ka lang sa Capital Region tapos occasionally dadalaw ka sa probins. San ka nakakita ng liga na KUMPANYA ang teams, hindi manlang mag represent ng lugar. Saan ka nakakita ng PRO BASKETBALL LEAGUE, may height limit yung mga foreign players? Saan ka nakakita ng Pro League na yung mga rookie, 24 years old na? 

SAAN KA NAKAKITA NG PRO LEAGUE, NA YUNG 3 TEAM HAWAK NG 1 KUMPANYA (MVP Group of companies) at YUNG 4 NA TEAMS HAWAK NG 1 TAO (San Miguel and check who's the majority shareholder ng Northport)?

Tapos yung ibang teams, wala ata ambisyon manalo. Nanghaharang ng kalaban na teams?

Ito ata pinakamatindi kong point pero BASKETBALL Palang yan ah. Palpak na.

Pwede naman kasi mag home-and-away eh. Bobo ba mga taga Cebu? Pulubi ba mga taga Davao? Tanga ba mga taga Pampanga? Mahihina ba mga taga Cagayan de Oro? Di ba nila kaya magkaroon ng sariling team sa Pambansang liga ng Basketball? At sa mga bball fans, don't even bring up MBA. Because the MBA literrallly tried to fight PBA. Walang kalaban ang PBA.

If you look at the champions of the German Soccer/Football League, it's BAYER Leverkusen. Yes, yung kumpanya ng gamot. Look at Japanese & Korean sports. Their sports teams are owned by big corpos yet they still make an effort to make their teams be based in a city o town.

Kasi sports ay community based. Malamang aasa lagi ang PBA sa Ginebra at sa Play-offs (kaya umaabot lagi ng Game 7 ang mga finals eh hahaha) para kumita. Sino susuporta sa talunan na Terrafirma? 

Look at Bayern Munich of Germany. Partly owned by adidas, Allianz, Audi at the rest of the 75% are owned by members of the club. Yes, you can be part of the ownership of the strongest football (heck, SPORTS club kasi meron din silang Basketball team and other sports). Eh yung Blackwater daw nalulugi na. Suggest ko sa kaniya, ibenta niya portion ng team para 2 yung nagpopondo. Blackwater sa harap ng Jersey, yung isang may-ari sa likod. Kaya mga talunan sila eh. Nahihirapan daw. 

You bring the sports to the people. And you give teams a chance to explore the best route to take for their team to grow. Dito sa PBA, BULOK. Asa sa superstar at sa Ginebra.

Yan din problema ng Volleyball, masyado minsan silang Showbiz.

If they try to base their teams sa isang community, you wil always have fans. And these fans are willing to pay. 

For other sports like Badminton, Baseball, Table Tennis, Gymnastics... Ganyan din. When sports is community based (Brgy, Town, Province, Region, company, school, random sports club... from the smallest to the biggest), then you have consistency in players, supporters and funding. 

And if you are consistent, then these communities can combine their efforts to continue to grow and send their best athletes to the next stage.

Sa Basketball, kung malakas ang PBA, matik malakas ang Gilas. It will be a matter of coaching and the funding of the national team itself. Pero kung individually, players are strong because they come from strong teams (Communities), then you can bet we have more chances of winning.

This applies to Volleyball, Soccer or Football, Baseball, and even individual sporst like Swimming and Athletics.

1exg2x3,Philippines,Pilots after training in PH,"Hi guys! I just finished my commercial pilot exam, only a few more hours required and I can enroll for CPL check-ride, (which is basically a practical check to which the designated pilot examiner from CAAP will evaluate your skills and competencies which they will decide if they will issue you a pilot license or not) and after then, I can apply for my Instrument Rating Course.

But with the issue here in the Philippines is that for you to apply in an airlines, you need at-least a minimum of 500 hrs plus an aircraft rating, (i.e. Airbus A320/A321, ATR, etc…) where unlike before COVID pandemic, airlines will sponsor you a type-rating (basically you will serve couple of years and with a contract, depending with the airlines) which is a good deal. The only option I had is enroll for flight instructor rating, though becoming a flight instructor is very hassle for my part, and really not my forte (Since I have evaluated myself that I cannot do this role, since I have the tendency to be irritated and be annoyed. (pls. don’t judge me lol) to a student when they have learning difficulties, etc…) It is also the same thing in the general aviation industry, although you have a minimum of at-least a CPL and/or IR rating, you still need to build hours for a specific aircraft they had, (i.e. Beechcraft Baron, King Air 350, etc…) another financial responsibility after flight training.

I have talked to some veteran pilots before, in their time they go with their fellow pilot friends to fly and build flying hours together until they reach a specific time to apply in an airlines in their time (which was around year 1980-2000s) without spending a large sum of money. Though today, I don’t have any information if there are some good pilots that offers that kind of stuff unlike in US where planes and flying is just like cars, hitchhiking wherever they want to go, or at-least having a minimum of CPL and/or IR rating you can join a company, just for the sake of time building, build and gain experience.

Also the same thing with the latest program of Cebu Pacific Cadet Pilot Program wherein they have launched a program dedicated to aspiring pilots who dreamed to become a pilot, but they only choose people who haven’t undergone flight training (if there is, a minimum of 10 hrs.). At-least they should have considered hiring fresh graduate pilots from various flying schools here in the Philippines rather than launching a cadet pilot program to a single flying school where in fact there are a lot of flying schools here in the Philippines, and we have too many surplus pilots here in the Philippines, most of them have Airbus, ME ratings.

Another thing I have noticed is that we do not have a pilot union, unlike in US, they have ALPA (Air Line Pilots Association) where they support pilots when it comes to pilot hiring, contracts and hiring conditions to pilots. Not even one politician ever open up this issue with the current trend of pilot surplus here in the Philippines.

With the booming aviation industry here in the Philippines, such as the mass orders of Cebu Pacific and Philippines Airlines in their fleet to follow-up with the high demand of passengers traveling in and out of the country, and the only convenient way to travel to other countries, they should also consider the fact that there are a lot of pilots who finished pilot training yet only very few can get into the aviation industry.

16vdcra,Philippines,got shouted and scolded on by a grab driver so i silently cried in the back seat,"i (F16) recently just moved here in Cebu about 2 months ago for school and knew nothing about the city and all these delivery, angkas and car/taxi booking apps were such a huge culture shock for me bc i came from a small town. today my dad and brother visited me in the city and decided we’d sleep in a hotel and spend a couple of days together before they go back. i recently also just went through a depressive episode and today i was just very out of the loop and sensitive.

i had forgotten my antidepressants back at my dorm in urgello (i go to school in southwe) so i decided i would go back and get them bc i can’t sleep without them but no taxi’s, angkas, move it and grab drivers were available in magallanes where our hotel was at so i walked about 10 minutes towards carbon market (?) in front of usjr and waited about an hour pacing back and forth desperately trying to find someone and i was really considering on paying 400 pesos for a 150 pesos trip (i always tip 50-100 pesos everytime i book though) until a grabtaxi driver accepted. i explicitly said that i was in front of usjr sa carbon market. he said he was there but i couldnt find him bc i really wasnt familiar with the place so i ran like everywhere trying to find him T__T around 5 minutes later i spotted his plate number in a place that was kinda far from where i instructed so i was confused ?? but nevertheless i immediately said sorry when i went inside but then he started shouting at me and telling me that i wasted his time and i was stupid bc of the way i booked my ride and i was apologizing really hard and told him that i was lost and i was new here and i just put in the place i saw where i was in and booked even though i booked accurately and told him my EXACT location but i really just wanted the screaming to end and when everything fell quiet i just broke down at the backseat and when i arrived to my dorm i was crying for an hour cursing myself. i wanted to be petty and not give him a tip but i felt so bad and ended up giving him 2 stars and a php50 tip for inconvenience 

this was my first ever encounter like this because all of the grab cars i booked were really sweet. i never expected someone to shout at me like that bc my dad doesn’t even do that to me??? nevertheless, i tipped my grab driver 200 pesos my ride back to my hotel","got shouted and scolded on by a grab driver so i silently cried in the back seat i (f16) recently just moved here in cebu about 2 months ago for school and knew nothing about the city and all these delivery, angkas and car/taxi booking apps were such a huge culture shock for me bc i came from a small town. today my dad and brother visited me in the city and decided we’d sleep in a hotel and spend a couple of days together before they go back. i recently also just went through a depressive episode and today i was just very out of the loop and sensitive.

xhm5d2,Philippines,Missed my flight because of Cebu Pacific and the Bureau of Immigration’s inefficiency,"UPDATE:

Today is the schedule of my rebooked flight. Arrived 5 HOURS earlier. Queued at immigration around 3:35. GRABE PARIN ANG PILA. Baka naman maiwan pa ko neto? Lmao. 

—

Today, my CebPac flight left me because the Bureau of Immigration didn’t stamp my passport on time. 

In 2017, I was offloaded at Terminal 2 for the following reasons: (1) I just turned 18 and I was traveling alone; (2) I didn’t have a written consent from my legal guardian to travel; and (3) the country I wanted to visit is a popular transit country. The immigration officer flagged me as someone that could be easily trafficked. 

It was understandable and the ticket didn’t really cost much because I got it during a sale. 

Then on 2018, I went to Vietnam for an internship. Before I was able to pass through Immigration, I was held for about 30 mins. But I came prepared with the documents needed, i.e., invitation letter, endorsement letter from my school, guardian’s consent, and of course enough money. I asked the officer if I’ll be going through the same process the next time I travel. He said most likely, yes. 

In 2019, I went to Taiwan with my girlfriend. I was already anticipating that I will be held again at the immigration. As expected, I was held by immigration. I asked again if I will be held the next time. They said no, since I already have a good travel history and I come back on dates indicated on my itinerary. 

Fast forward to May 2022, my girlfriend and I went to Singapore. Our flight was 2 o’clock in the morning. I remember being told I won’t be held off at the immigration this time, but I still prepared anyway. When I got into immigration, I was told by the first level officer that my offload record is still there and he can’t manually override it. He needed a senior’s approval to stamp my passport. So I went back to the immigration office at the airport. It was just a 20 minute delay but I was pissed off because they previously told me I wouldnt have to go through this process again. After the interview, they stamped my passport. Before I left, I made sure to ask if it’s still the same process next time. The officer said no. I’ll be able to travel smoothly next time. 

Then now, September 2022, my girlfriend and I and her brother are traveling to Indonesia. We left Bulacan at 2pm. Our flight is at 8pm. We arrived around 4:15pm. We paid our travel tax and queued for the check-in baggage and boarding pass. 

It was already 6:20 when we got our boarding pass. We went straight to queue for the immigration booth but the line was CRAZY LONG and not all booths were manned by an officer. We were in line for more than an hour before I got to the booth. I was confident they wouldnt hold me up since I was assured during my Singapore trip that it wouldnt happen again. But IT DID. It was already 7:10 and I had to be at the boarding gate by 7:25. The officer, however, assured me that I would make it in time and guaranteed approval since I didn’t really have any requirements to submit and I had good travel history. So i went to the TCEU where I will be interviewed. It is where they decide if you will be offloaded or approved.

The lines werent long. There’s about 8-10 people and there were plenty of officers present. However, only 4-5 officers were actually interviewing passengers. I saw one officer on her iPad scrolling through Facebook and it clearly wasnt their break. WTF. People were already complaining because their flights will depart in less than 30 mins. Officers were taking a really long time interviewing the passengers. We asked if ot can be expedited and they just said “Government agency to, mag expect kayo na matagal talaga pila.” huh? Tangina ba kayo? Government agency synonymous with inefficiency? 

Anyway it was already 7:50 and I still wasnt approved. I was literally sobbing thinking my girlfriend had to leave without me. We were both confident we would make it on time that’s why I told her to go first. If I hadn’t, pati sila ng kapatid nya maiiwan kakaantay sakin.

My flight left already but they told me to stay. They approved my papers and just said “Rebook ka nalang. At least ikaw makakapagrebook kasi approved ka. Yung iba offloaded talaga. Sa susunod 4 hours dapat andito na kayo.” the fuck? Was I supposed to thank them for ruining my trip? We arrived 4 hours before the flight. 

The queue at CebPac’s check in counters were long af because their self-check in kiosks werent working. The lines at the immigration booth were moving so freaking slow because not all booths were manned. The lines at the immigration interview area werent moving because not all present officers were actively questioning the held passengers. There wasnt even a CebPac flight attendant doing a roll-call for passengers who are nearing boarding time, whereas FAs from Emirates, Quantas, AirAsia, and Royal Dutch were actively calling for any passenger left. 

Neither CebPac nor BOI gave a fuck about wasted time, money, and plans. Inefficient pigs. Now I have to wait three days for the next available flight to Jakarta. Ridiculous.

EDIT: The sad thing is I was always held off because I had a previous record, not because I have questionable documents like most other held off passengers. 

I always come back sa Pilipinas exactly on the date indicated in my itinerary. I have proof of employment stating I am a consultant for a PH agency (which is a government agency as well). So they really couldnt get dirt on me and offload me if they wanted because they need to get that in writing. Sadly, they could bury me in line long enough for my flight to leave without me boarding. I waited more than an hour for the interview queue, but the actual interview was just about 10-15 mins or so. Other passengers were interviewed far longer. Yung isang pasahero, mag iisang oras halos ininterview ng officer. 

I also never got a proper explanation for why this keeps happening when some of the officers themselves are wondering why it is still on my record despite being able to travel 3 times after the first offload incident.","missed my flight because of cebu pacific and the bureau of immigration’s inefficiency update:

today is the schedule of my rebooked flight. arrived 5 hours earlier. queued at immigration around 3:35. grabe parin ang pila. baka naman maiwan pa ko neto? lmao. 

—

today, my cebpac flight left me because the bureau of immigration didn’t stamp my passport on time. 

in 2017, i was offloaded at terminal 2 for the following reasons: (1) i just turned 18 and i was traveling alone; (2) i didn’t have a written consent from my legal guardian to travel; and (3) the country i wanted to visit is a popular transit country. the immigration officer flagged me as someone that could be easily trafficked. 

it was understandable and the ticket didn’t really cost much because i got it during a sale. 

then on 2018, i went to vietnam for an internship. before i was able to pass through immigration, i was held for about 30 mins. but i came prepared with the documents needed, i.e., invitation letter, endorsement letter from my school, guardian’s consent, and of course enough money. i asked the officer if i’ll be going through the same process the next time i travel. he said most likely, yes. 

in 2019, i went to taiwan with my girlfriend. i was already anticipating that i will be held again at the immigration. as expected, i was held by immigration. i asked again if i will be held the next time. they said no, since i already have a good travel history and i come back on dates indicated on my itinerary. 

fast forward to may 2022, my girlfriend and i went to singapore. our flight was 2 o’clock in the morning. i remember being told i won’t be held off at the immigration this time, but i still prepared anyway. when i got into immigration, i was told by the first level officer that my offload record is still there and he can’t manually override it. he needed a senior’s approval to stamp my passport. so i went back to the immigration office at the airport. it was just a 20 minute delay but i was pissed off because they previously told me i wouldnt have to go through this process again. after the interview, they stamped my passport. before i left, i made sure to ask if it’s still the same process next time. the officer said no. i’ll be able to travel smoothly next time. 

then now, september 2022, my girlfriend and i and her brother are traveling to indonesia. we left bulacan at 2pm. our flight is at 8pm. we arrived around 4:15pm. we paid our travel tax and queued for the check-in baggage and boarding pass. 

it was already 6:20 when we got our boarding pass. we went straight to queue for the immigration booth but the line was crazy long and not all booths were manned by an officer. we were in line for more than an hour before i got to the booth. i was confident they wouldnt hold me up since i was assured during my singapore trip that it wouldnt happen again. but it did. it was already 7:10 and i had to be at the boarding gate by 7:25. the officer, however, assured me that i would make it in time and guaranteed approval since i didn’t really have any requirements to submit and i had good travel history. so i went to the tceu where i will be interviewed. it is where they decide if you will be offloaded or approved.

the lines werent long. there’s about 8-10 people and there were plenty of officers present. however, only 4-5 officers were actually interviewing passengers. i saw one officer on her ipad scrolling through facebook and it clearly wasnt their break. wtf. people were already complaining because their flights will depart in less than 30 mins. officers were taking a really long time interviewing the passengers. we asked if ot can be expedited and they just said “government agency to, mag expect kayo na matagal talaga pila.” huh? tangina ba kayo? government agency synonymous with inefficiency? 

anyway it was already 7:50 and i still wasnt approved. i was literally sobbing thinking my girlfriend had to leave without me. we were both confident we would make it on time that’s why i told her to go first. if i hadn’t, pati sila ng kapatid nya maiiwan kakaantay sakin.

my flight left already but they told me to stay. they approved my papers and just said “rebook ka nalang. at least ikaw makakapagrebook kasi approved ka. yung iba offloaded talaga. sa susunod 4 hours dapat andito na kayo.” the fuck? was i supposed to thank them for ruining my trip? we arrived 4 hours before the flight. 

the queue at cebpac’s check in counters were long af because their self-check in kiosks werent working. the lines at the immigration booth were moving so freaking slow because not all booths were manned. the lines at the immigration interview area werent moving because not all present officers were actively questioning the held passengers. there wasnt even a cebpac flight attendant doing a roll-call for passengers who are nearing boarding time, whereas fas from emirates, quantas, airasia, and royal dutch were actively calling for any passenger left. 

neither cebpac nor boi gave a fuck about wasted time, money, and plans. inefficient pigs. now i have to wait three days for the next available flight to jakarta. ridiculous.

2.I think Cebu is better for tourism, and from there you can travel easily to other A-plus destinations like Bohol, Malapascua, and Boracay (though I find the latter overrated).  

3. International airport is already available so I think it won't be so difficult to travel to other countries.  

Cons:
1.  No light rail train yet.  
2.  NCR still has an edge in schools, Colleges and Universities.

1dnbcg8,Cebu,TERRIBLE experience at Cebu Doctors University Hospital. Advice needed.,"TLDR: One CT scan turned into four without my knowledge. Avoid getting CT scans at Cebu Doctors University, Cebu City.



Last week I found a lump in my neck and the ENT I saw ordered a non-contrast CT scan. I questioned the Dr on why non-contrast and he said ""if they see something they will do contrast"". Fair enough. So I walked across to Cebu Doctors University Hospital in Cebu City expecting 1 or 2 CT scans on my neck.

At the hospital a nurse puts me in the CT scanner and then leaves the room. The scan commences and once the buzzing and whirring of the machine stops the original nurse walks back in accompanied by a guy (probably the radiologist). I assume the scan is finished, but instead the guy asks me to adjust my head position and then walks off without another word. The buzzing and whirring of the machine re-starts.

This time, when the machine stops the nurse comes back in and with a nice friendly smile tells me I can leave. I leave the scanning room, enter the waiting area and make for the exit. But before I can leave another nurse runs up to me and says ""sir we need to do a contrast scan!"". I am a bit confused since the two nurses have now said something different, but I ask ""Did they find something?"", she replies ""yes"", So I ask again ""Is it here?"" and point to the lump on my neck, ""yes"" she says.

Ok so now I am freaking out a bit and thoughts of cancer are popping into my mind. The nurse asks me a bunch of routine questions, palpates my lump etc. Then asks me to get a blood test prior to the contrast scan.

The blood test took about 3 hours, then I returned for the contrast scan. They hook up the IV line and put me in the scanner (this was a different scanner to the one earlier). So at this point I am expecting a contrast scan since I have a needle sticking in my arm and was told this is a CONTRAST scan. The machine starts up, but I feel no contrast entering my vein. The machine keeps buzzing and I keep waiting...and waiting...no contrast....finally I hear a voice over the speaker ""OK administering the contrast now"".

I immediately realise they are administering a WITH and WITHOUT CONTRAST scan and think to myself: ""WTF!!! did these clowns forget I was here 3 hours ago for a non-contrast scan??? Or did they really find something serious and need to retake these images"". Once the scanning had stopped I decided to keep my mouth shut, so I leave with my anxiety through the roof expecting horrible news and wait for my results.

The following day I get my results and.... no cancer, no swollen lymphnodes, nada, nothing. Ok so now I start to get angry that I was scanned 3 times (spoiler alert: it was actually 4), and I want some damn answers. So I confront the medical team.

I am still confused by what went down that day, but here it is to the best of my knowledge based on their answers.

1. The first non-contrast scan had 'streaking' so they decided to re-take it (that is why the guy entered the room to adjust my position). The streaking was an issue with the machine.

2. The second scan also had streaking...

3. They decided to do another re-take, this time with contrast and in a different machine, but apparently they could not do contrast only, it had to be with and without contrast.

So 4 scans all up. And throughout that entire process did anybody communicate with me what was going on? Nope. I had no idea the first non-contrast scan failed, no idea there was a second non-contrast scan and that it failed too, and no idea that a ""contrast scan"" is apparently code for ""with and without contrast"". The communication was abysmal, in fact the communication was in negative territory because the information I was told by one nurse was false. She told me that I needed a contrast scan because they found something in the non-contrast scan. Which wasn't true, they just had to switch me to another machine because the first one was producing poor quality imaging.

It gets better, the kicker: I was told the streaking was around the collarbone, my lump is at the level of the Adam's Apple, so the first image might have been usable? But nobody checked with me. Feels good to get blasted 4 times by ionising radiation. Highly recommend.

Anyone here have any advice about my situation? Can I make a formal complaint? To the Hospital? Department of Health? Any radiologists want to chime in about this experience? I'm worried about the cancer risk.","terrible experience at cebu doctors university hospital. advice needed. tldr: one ct scan turned into four without my knowledge. avoid getting ct scans at cebu doctors university, cebu city.

Bag o lang mi nagstorya sa akong igsuon na kulang daw iyang allowance na ako ihatag weekly. Hatagan naku siya ug 2100 per week pero dili na siya muoli ug balay weekly. Basically, 2100 is for everything na from food, transpo, personal needs nya. Except project2 sa skwelahan or mga dagko na amotan, ako na mubayad ana. Ako magpaload sa wifi nya para naa siyay internet entire month. One ride to school, pwede sad lakawon kung dili gipit sa oras. 

Bale ako gi kwenta 300 per day is enough man siguro for a student. Nangutana pud ko sa akong friends and all of them are saying na dako ra gyud ang 2100 na weekly.

“Feeling nako bagay kaayo ta,” hunghong niya, ngadto sa cellphone.

Wa ko kabalo unsay reply sa pikas linya. Pero kalami jud kusion sa ngisi aning bataa. Skibidi toilet rizz. The audacity!

If we consult science: “The human brain continues developing and maturing well into the mid-to-late 20s. The prefrontal cortex, responsible for higher-level cognitive functions, doesn’t fully mature until around 25.” No wonder I made some of the dumbest decisions in my early twenties.

“Magpahimo kog jersey, dayon imohang first letter akong ibutang.”  

That line triggered my quarter-life crisis. Deeeymn. At 12, I was still trying to solve E=mc2, pretending to understand The Myth of Sisyphus. Bitaw, ga-Google pa kog “Naruto iyot Sakura” ani. Maybe we were all delusional once.

This isn’t a cautionary tale. This is a brain map. A logbook of someone whose mind was still buffering until his late twenties.

21
Graduated from college. First real relationship. Got a job 3 months later. Sure na ko nga milyonaryo ko by 25. Abi nako nga ang pagka-busy = pagka-successful. Told people “C.R.E.A.M.” while still clueless unsaon pag-fill out BIR Form 2316.

Brain status: Not fully developed. Decision-making driven by caffeine and horny optimism. Prefrontal cortex? Optional.

22–23
Nagbuwag mi sa akong uyab. Friendly breakup, daw. Focus sa career. Fixed myself from switching between gin to rhum, from F. Sionil Jose to unread PDFs.  

Became a minimalist not by choice—but by payslip. Bought 4 cheap underwears. Gave unsolicited life advice while being a full-time mess.  

Told my cat, “I’m emotionally intelligent,” pero I refuse to apologize kung malimtan nako iyang treat.

Brain status: Aware of mistakes. Still makes them. But now, louder and bolder.

24–25
Burnt out sa work. Realized I was just another metric. KPIs > human worth.  

Nagsugod kog skincare routine. Nagka-identity crisis. Nagbasa’g astrology for answers pero gihasulan ko. Kinsa may makahinumdom unsa orasa sila nigawas sa bilahan sa ilang mama? Ambot sa kanding nga naay bangs, oral stage pa ko ato. 

Brain status: Fully developed? Questionable. Introspective but unstable.

26–27
Tried to be serious with life. Took LinkedIn seriously. Landed a job in Cebu City. Moved there to avoid the Old Bridge’s traffic and my old self.  

Maka-afford na ko og mahalon nga brief.  
Nangutana bitaw na akong Tagalog nga boss about status, “Kumusta iyong lagay diyan?”  
“Naka-Airism na, boss.”  Naks. Fresh. Silky smooth. Lami kaayo sa itlog.

I worked hard, questioned harder. Felt like I was assembling a trillion-piece jigsaw puzzle with no box cover.

Brain status: Functional. Capable of major decisions. Everything feels possible. Nothing makes sense.

27–28
Dili ko sure unsay konek ani sa brain development, pero uwagan ko ani nga time. Murag Kopiko Creamy Latte—pero from creamier to horniest.

Kada uli lagi lu2— Calorie-deficit man gud ko, so need ko magluto to track my macros: 100g chicken breast + 40g oats + 20g chia = 404kcal. Murag sayop akong math. Pero at least naay effort.

I found peace in chaos. Like the Titanic orchestra—still playing while sinking. Took breaks from productivity to stare at the moon and ask: “Ngano dako kaayo kog tax deduction, pero katong galingkod diha sa ibabaw kay mura man og spa day everyday?”

Brain status: Stabilizing. Can spot red flags. But still confused why Filipinos can’t vote wisely.

28–29
Silence is peaceful.

Ooooohhhmmmm…

Freedom isn’t chasing dreams. It’s walking away from someone else’s.

Brain status: Syncing with soul. Still weird. Still functional.

Wa pa ko kahuman og pagka-trenta. So far? No grand narrative. The world is gloriously stupid—and so am I.

I stopped obsessing over what I should be. I started focusing on what doesn’t make me hate mornings. Pero kung makakaon ta’g lami nga sud-an, makakita’g tawo who laughs at our dumbest joke, o kalinaw ug kaanyag ba kaha kada-adlaw —we’ve won.

Brain and soul? Not enemies anymore. Just rabid D/D/S.

If I were to interrupt my cousin’s deep talk, I’d say:

1h0tce8,Cebu,SOMEONE NEEDS TO STUDY THE SUNTAR CEBU COMMENTS SECTION!,"I studied Mass Communication and Journalism in college, and I’ve always been fascinated by how society consumes news. Today, I stumbled upon the comments section of [SunStar Cebu’s post](https://www.facebook.com/sunstarcebu/posts/609029661795550), and I found it incredibly fascinating.

Here’s some context: SunStar Cebu posted a story about a flowchart that Senator Risa Hontiveros had originally shared on her social media. The flowchart, which is essentially an organizational chart or “matrix,” claims to show individuals allegedly tied to POGOs. Among those named in the matrix is former President Rodrigo Duterte, which naturally stirred some strong reactions. SunStar didn’t just write about the matrix—they only re-uploaded the image from Hontiveros’ post, effectively framing it as news and sparking a wave of commentary.

What's so interesting about this post is not the content of the matrix itself—it was how people reacted to it. If you scroll through the comments, you’ll find a mix of sarcasm and outright hostility. Comments like:

* “Hoy SunStar, pamisik mo Christmas bonus ninyo oy!”
* “No. 1 na c SunStar ani ehehe.”
* “Nice classroom organizational chart… :D”
* “Nagka wala buot najod ning uban sa gobyerno, grabeha najod maka pang-daut, may pa matrix matrix pang boeng.”
* “SOLID DU30 PARIN .”
* Hello! How's PHILHEALTH in the Phi?
* Panakip butas ni Niya sa iyang wrong turn sa SENATE, hahaha bagsak sa research!"", ""SOLID DU30 PARIN""
* Nagsalita ang Phil Health Queen
* wa lage nmo gi apil imong ngan diha mam human rights Risa H... ikaw raman nka kuwang dha.. twon oi..""

What’s interesting is that almost none of these comments actually engage with the matrix itself. There’s no attempt to analyze the content, evaluate the claims, or even consider the implications. Instead, the comments are focused on dismissing the news entirely or mocking both Hontiveros and SunStar Cebu. A few even dig up unrelated controversies, like PhilHealth issues linked to Hontiveros, as a way to discredit her entirely.

This kind of reaction raises some really fascinating questions for me about how people engage with political news on social media. A lot of what’s happening in these comments isn’t about the matrix at all! It’s about loyalty, mistrust, and the way people use humor and sarcasm to avoid deeper engagement.

For example, many of the commenters are clearly pro-Duterte and see the matrix as a baseless attack on him. Instead of considering the possibility of its validity, they immediately go into defense mode, accusing SunStar of bias or insinuating that the story was paid for. Comments like “Pila may gi bayad sa mga bangag nimu” (How much were your addicts paid?) reflect a deep distrust of news media.

Then there’s the use of sarcasm. Comments like “Nice classroom organizational chart” or “pamisik mo Christmas bonus ninyo oy” make light of the situation, almost as if to say, “This isn’t worth taking seriously.” It’s a common way people deflect from heavy topics online. By turning them into jokes or memes. But it also stops the conversation from going anywhere meaningful. :( 

Another thing I noticed is how partisan loyalty completely dominates the discussion. The overwhelming support for Duterte in these comments isn’t surprising, but it’s fascinating to see how quickly any criticism of him is dismissed as malicious or unfounded. This kind of tribalism creates an “us vs. them” dynamic, where the goal isn’t to debate ideas but to defend your side at all costs. Even the local news outlet SunStar, whose only job is to relay information to the masses, wasn’t spared from the hostility. Instead of seeing the report as neutral or informative, people attacked it as biased or agenda-driven.

So what does all of this tell us? It’s a snapshot of how deeply polarized we’ve become, not just in terms of political loyalties but in the way we interact with information. People aren’t engaging with the facts or even debating the issue—they’re reacting emotionally, drawing from past grievances (like PhilHealth), and leaning on sarcasm or hostility to shut down the conversation entirely. Social media, instead of fostering discussion, often becomes a battleground where the loudest voices drown out any attempt at critical thought.

It’s a messy, chaotic phenomenon, but it’s also incredibly revealing. The SunStar Cebu comments aren’t just about a flowchart or even about Risa Hontiveros—they’re a window into how Filipinos are navigating (or not navigating) political discourse in the digital age. It kinda makes me sad. Rant done.","someone needs to study the suntar cebu comments section! i studied mass communication and journalism in college, and i’ve always been fascinated by how society consumes news. today, i stumbled upon the comments section of [sunstar cebu’s post](https://www.facebook.com/sunstarcebu/posts/609029661795550), and i found it incredibly fascinating.

1kim00t,Cebu,Daghan options for activities sa Cebu if you know where to find them.,"Mao ni ako nabantayan sa atong community. Daghan kaayo tag lingaw nga pwede apilan.

Cebu Island with its HUCs can be around 5.3 Million people. If sa Metro Cebu it’s 3 Million. It’s huge. In a sense, pero we seem to know people from around. Like, naa tay connection bisan sa pinakarandom nga taw. We’re somehow knitted. Hahaha.

So, akong activities as a 30 year old single guy kay gasamual. In a week, daghan kog invites.

For instance:

1. Naa koy gym buddies, nagstart ko nga walay kaila, until in a span of few months, naa nay makigdungan.
My friends nga mga babaye kay niapil ug pilates. All of us started zero. Then karon, naa na sila friends sa pilates then naa sad ko sa gym. 

Nagstart ra ko simply, I enrolled ra sa AF. Nagpatudlo sa basic forms, then muadto na ko alone, then naa na dayun koy kuyog. The best way to start kay dapat dili maulaw. Hahaha.

2. Sa badminton. I learned how to play badminton 3 years ago, late 20s na. Sa work nag-start, kanang invites after work. Akong mga kaduwa karun mga teenagers and mga early 20s na kay my workmates are not playing anymore. Naa koy laing groups na, mas batan-on and mas kusog, mga players sa ilang SHS and College. Had I started earlier basin pwede siguro ko mag-compete. Hehehe. Taas man kog hangin.

3. Naa nasad ko new bisyo ron, ang mag-trekking. Aw before pandemic, naa mi small group. Lain sad to nga group of people, not really my main circle of friends. Pero in once a month nga mu-hike mi, close kaayo mi. And then magsaba lang if naa nasad activities. Right now, naa koy new group and mas bata ang uban nako, and I don’t feel excluded at all. Like I only knew them recently because nag-ask ra ko sa FB asa makakitag guide then they let me join sa ilang group! And they let me join sa hike in that week agad-agad. How wholesome is that? Hahaha.

4. Don’t get me started sa running. 2020 nga time, nag-running era na ko. I was 25. So, akong friends before ko ni-undang sa running kay nagpadayun gihapon today. And naa koy main circle nga friend nga until now nagsigeg dagan, and naa nasad siya groups of runners sa Cebu. And maka-place na siya sa mga half and full marathon. Im so proud.

5. Naa koy invitations pud nga magplay kog volleyball. Kanang volleyball nga kanto2 gud, walay training. Gipaapil ko once, months ago. And then, after 2 times nga nakaplay, naa nako sa ilang GC nga manulong ug duwa sa mga barangay2. Sugalay. 25 pesos per player. Hahahaha. Di ko maayo. Kahibaw ra ko sa basic sad. Pero I feel included nila. Reserved lang sapat na. HAHAHAHA

So mao to ako narealize, daghan kog community. And di man sad na nako apilan every week oy, kay naa man trabaho. Nice sa feeling nga naa koy invites and if mutunong sa akong free time, muapil ko nila. Diba? Ka-relate mo nako? Naa koy gi-look forward sa akong week. And these people kay although di kaayo mi suod kay we’re friends sa among common interest.

Dapat diay dili ra ta sigeg trabaho pud. HAHAHA.

1izbad6,Cebu,Pila na ang sweldo sa helper karon sa Cebu?,"The question isn’t as simple, tho. I’ll give you some context. 

Kani siya nga helper kay na helper na ni namo sauna, mga 10 years ago katong single pa siya. Buotan kaayo, sigeg panlimpyo, nakauyon jud akong mama, part of the family na kumbaga. But she had to leave kay she wants to start her own family as well. We still keep in touch kay lagi, dugay siya namo ug ganahan sad jud akong mama niya.

Over the years, mag bisita bisita siya diri sa amo with her kids and recently, nakabisita siya niya nirequest akong mama if pwede siya mag helper kay sige nag sakit iyang lawas, busy napud ko ug work and need lang jud niya ma maintain ang cleanliness sa balay ug ang panglaba mostly. Since dagko nami, di na kaayo high maintenance and okay ra stay out (they found a place atbang ra sa among subdivision), nya kuyog ra sad niya iyang duha anak (3yo and 7yo, both male). 

Karon, apil sila sa among konsumo jud. Buntag usto panihapon. Diri sad sila tanan maligo. Asta sa snacks diri sila nya since growing kids man, dako2 jud ug eat hehe. Iyang eldest na nag school na, ari sad maligo ug mamahaw before muadto sa school. We’re happy to share what we have kay walang wala jud sila sa ilang probinsya, pero dili sad mi ingon super well-put off na family. I have 3 sisters pa nga gaskwela, college ang duha. Nakabantay lang akong mama na medyo napun-an lang jud ang cost sa amo consumo, and our groceries na pang 2 weeks before, pang 1 week ra karon. Maguilty sad mi mangwenta kay buotan jd kaayo si ate (amo helper), medyo galisod lang pd mi ug apas sa gastuonon labi na mahal kaayo ang presyo karon.

If this is the case, pilay angay isweldo sa among helper? Kay kbaw ko ang kasagaran karon di munaog ug 7k if wa ko masayop.

Grabe amo kakulba sa nahitabo, bag-ohay rani, karon ra jud pag alas 6 sa gabii. Basin you experienced the same thing.

Naglakaw mi ganeha sa ako friend from Colon and naglakaw mi kilid sa CEC (Cebu Eastern College). While talking, nakabantay mi nga naay nagsunod namo. At first nagtuo mi nga lalaki kay she was wearing pants, t-shirt and a cap, dili jud namo ma klaro kaayo kay medyo ngitngit. 

Mao to nilabang mi sa ako friend sa pikas side sa dalan kay weird jud sya as lain iya vibes. To our horror, ni aksyon pud sya ug labang so we stayed on our lane, she also stayed on the same lane. Dira pa lang lain na jud amo pamati niya. So we decided nga mo labang ug dayun, thank God wala sya nakasunod kay gipauna jud namo siya ug lakaw.

So we decided nga mo labang sa lane kung asa siya nagbarog (sounds stupid but that was the best choice we did).

Pag labang namo, nya hapit nami maabot kung asa siya nagbarog, anha pa siya nilabang sa lane nga among gilakawan. 

Sa kakuyaw namo kay ni straight mi sa may Panganiban St. and sige mi ug lingo if nisunod ba siya. Pag tan-aw namo kay wala diay sya nilahos sa eskina padung Carbon. Naglingi-lingi, murag nangita namo. Mao to naahat nalang mi sakay jeep para dili mi niya makit-an kay nilakaw man siya balik sa agi kung asa mi niya last nakit-an.

However, none of the people I know in my almost 30 years being a resident in the City have tasted/eaten or even seen an actual Mabolo fruit.

Not one from college, work, business, etc. and I find it weird and ironic..

I havent seen one in groceries or market, even in Carbon.. none.. zero..

No friends, batchmates, collegue, relative of my wife, or even asking a random person (on the street) know what it is or how it looks like.. let alone how it taste .

the thing is it is a staple in my childhood, we have a huge mabolo tree back in my town, and our Church (a Cathedral) is also surrounded by lots of Mabolo trees which gives free fruit to everyone.. 

Wla lang i just found it funny, everyone know where brgy Mabolo is, but no one knows about the actual fruit..

most in the Philippine call it by another name.. Kamagong. 

How about here in Cebu reddit, you guys know, eaten, or saw the fruit? its been 25+ years since ive eaten one and its back home.. never saw it even once in Cebu

there is one way to know if you have and youre not lying.. How did you remove the itchy part of the fruit?

1iko3eg,Cebu,Went out by myself and I felt a bit lonely. Wanna meet people in Cebu!,"Hi! I recently moved to Cebu since November of last year for my licensure review and examination. I kinda spontaneously decided that I should go out and treat myself today. I saw a news article about Molave St. about their pop-up shops and decided to go there. To my dismay, the street was empty, so I just decided to walk back to the main road and head home. I was tired from walking and decided to stay at a cute coffee shop called Luna Gazette. I was going out when I heard a lot of noise at the back exit, and I honestly didn't know there was a garage sale called ""Just Another Garage Sale"" at Atua Midtown! The stuff that I was looking for at the Molave St. was there!

I almost missed it so I decided that I should stay for a while to listen to music and look at the shops. Then, a few minutes in, it kinda punched me in the gut really hard how alone I was at that time and (I'm usually fine going out with myself), how I just accidentally went to a cool place, and I'm really not really meeting new people. I was mostly listening to the indie bands while chatting with my friends, but they aren't in Cebu ofc. It's mostly just ""wish you were here"" stuff.

So, with all my woes and incoherent ramblings, I actually wanna meet new people in Cebu to go to cafes, pop-up shops, and actually have conversations and make friends. If you're up for it, here's a little background about me: I'm 24 years' old, a recent college graduate studying for my licensure exam, I am a digital artist, more specifically pixel art, and I'm looking for friends in Cebu! So, if you're the kind of indie girlie (or guy or non-bi) who wants to hang out from time to time and show me around, hit me up!

Edit: making it a bit coherent, pardon my excitement lol","went out by myself and i felt a bit lonely. wanna meet people in cebu! hi! i recently moved to cebu since november of last year for my licensure review and examination. i kinda spontaneously decided that i should go out and treat myself today. i saw a news article about molave st. about their pop-up shops and decided to go there. to my dismay, the street was empty, so i just decided to walk back to the main road and head home. i was tired from walking and decided to stay at a cute coffee shop called luna gazette. i was going out when i heard a lot of noise at the back exit, and i honestly didn't know there was a garage sale called ""just another garage sale"" at atua midtown! the stuff that i was looking for at the molave st. was there!

1kyfuyy,Cebu,Need advice about medical assistance program,"Hi everyone. Let me introduce myself: I'm an 18 y.o. male and an incoming college freshman. Naa koy limited mobility and chronic pain sa akong right shoulder, giantus nako for 3 years na, sukad May 2022. Nagpa-check up ko sa physical therapy department sa Vicente Sotto Memorial Medical Center pag-24th March 2025, ug gi-diagnose ko with Shoulder Impingement Syndrome. Didto pud ko gi-assign og six ka sessions para pa-physical therapy, each kay 30 minutes ra. Pero upat ra akong na-attend, kay timing nga finals man pud namo sa skwelahan ato, nya gipadali og submit sa mga projects, tungod 3 weeks nalang gud before graduation day namo. During those times, I tried my best to regularly do the home exercises nga gi-assign sa ako, especially the bath towel stretch every after human nako og ligo. Pero, after all those exercises ug PT kay wala gyuy improvement akong condition.   
  
Gipa-Xray scan akong right shoulder, dayon wala man silay nakitang problema daw sa akong results. So I believe nga sa soft tissues ni siya sa akong right shoulder, kay bukog ra man gyud ang makuha sa X-ray. Maong gakinahanglan kong magpa-MRI aron mahibaw-an kung kailangan ba ni og surgery aron mabalik sa normal. Akong problema kay wala koy pambayad, nya ang gi-recommend sa akong friend kay mudangop daw ko sa Medical Assistance Program (MAP) sa PCSO. Ingon siya nako nga kadaghan na daw nag-avail ato iyang mama ug lola. So akong plano ron kay magpa-second opinion sa Cebu Orthopaedic Institute, which nabasahan nako nga naa silay arthroscopic shoulder surgery diin pwede daw makauli ang patient on the same day sa operation. Kini siyang arthroscopic shoulder surgery kay recommended treatment daw para sa akong condition, ug nabasahan pud nako nga covered siya sa MAP under ""Minimally Invasive Procedures"". Another problem nalang nako is ang pambayad para pa-second opinion, which I read nga around P800.   
  
Kahibaw na ko unsaon pag-apply para sa MAP, pero dili ko sure unsay i-expect. So, mangayo lang ko og advice sa mga mas knowledgeable ani, especially katung mga nakasuway na og avail. Mu-reject kaha sila og application, especially kung surgery? Pero minimally invasive ra man ning akoa :(   
  
Mao ra gyud ni ang solution nga madaganan nako, kay syempre wala koy pambayad pang-surgery. DESPERADO kong ma-fully heal na akong condition before magsugod ang klase, nya college na baya ni. Constant disturbance gyud ni siya sa akoa samtang mag-study, naapektuhan na akong academic performance, especially kung mutukar siya. It has already taken its toll on my mental health, and I won't let it hold me back anymore this time. I CAN'T fail this last and greatest step of my educational journey, which will dictate the rest of my life. Thank you for taking the time to read and for any advice.

1f9ky5v,Cebu,Need advice on international school near Cebu city,"Hello, American Veteran, 34 y/o. I am half Filipino with a half Filipino wife. When we visited Cebu a few years ago, we fell in love with it, especially after experiencing so many other cities. The malls, business parks, and restaurants just won my wife and kids over. I am searching for the top international schools in Cebu to significantly enhance my children's educational experience. My children range in age from 1 to 15. I would prefer a school that serves grades K–12, so they can all attend the same school. I've been conducting numerous review searches, but I'm finding it difficult to make a decision. I've heard excellent things about Sacred Heart in Cebu International School, but what would you recommend? Also, I see many of the schools offer lodging. That isn't something we're looking for. We're looking for our children to have the best opportunities in the basics of math, reading, and writing, as well as extracurricular activities such as sports, clubs, etc. We would greatly appreciate any assistance you could provide. We will base our residency off the school's location, as our children are our primary focus. And I understand and welcome that they'll need tutoring to catch up in their studies.

Fresh grad ko pag 2023, sa Manila ko nag school and nidecide ko muuli sa Cebu para diri na magwork kay naa man sad diri akong fam. Before ko nigraduate, naa nakoy working experience with 2 call center companies. 

Came across Abaca's job opening on Indeed and niapply ko atong Service Associate na role. Entry-level, open for fresh grads. Nice ra. They invited me for an interview and pagabot nako didto sa Crossroads, ubay ubay diay mi. 

Katong ako na ang gitawag, ang naginterview nako kay katong Operations Manager nila. Giscan pa niya first akong resume ana sya nga ""manila ka nigraduate? Naa kay latin honor? Call center ni imong background?"" So interview na and basic questions lang like tell me about yourself yada yada, iyang next questions were focused na sa akong work experience kay murag nag alin-langan sya sa akong call center exp. Then he asked, ""why would I consider you for this job?"" ""different man ang customer service thru phone and face-to-face, do you think you can handle?"" I know these are situational questions lang but mostly sa iyang questions ni focus jud sa difference sa real-life and phone service. 

Then ni proceed siyag ingon nga ""gaan tikag chance but di mi ganahan ug maldita, tapulan, ug reklamador. Mu work ka wala pay adlaw, muuli ka wala nay adlaw. Naa kay rest day but we would appreciate an employee nga kaya muwork throughout the week""

Nagwonder ko  nganong nakaingon sya nga ug ingon ato nga maldita, reklamador, and tapulan, is it because of my work background? Para niya tanan call center tapulan and reklamador? or tungod ba kay sa Manila ko gikan? Or sa akong honor? Feeling niya entitled ko kay mao na akong academic achievement? Wala ko kasabot, wala pud ko nangayog feedback kay I was taken aback nga iyang gipafeel nako nga dili unta ko niya iconsider sa role but iya rakong gaan ug chance. Mura kog niapply for managerial position nga dili pa kaayo qualified lol. As a breadwinner, na-insult jud ko. Also red flag kaayo nga ilang offer minimum rate pero ilang employees walay work and life balance. Proud pa sya nga giingon ana nila ilang employees and even encouraged nga dili mag rest day lol.

1i4ry71,Cebu,"Since when did parties, drinking, and rowdiness become the norms of Sinulog?","Asking this as I’m not a full-blooded Cebuano (I’m a Mindanaoan, born and raised there for the first two-thirds of my life) and that the festival culture here is significantly different from my home land. 

The first time I’ve settled here (senior high school, 2016) my classmates were sharing their crazy Sinulog stories, mostly being exactly those 3 things I mentioned above in the title. Call me a ‘boomer’ but I don’t think those should be the main highlights/attractions of Sinulog—it’s a **religious-cultural festival** after all so the ideal celebration is attending **novenas and processions** (that’s if you’re a devout Catholic) and watching the **dances, float parades, and fireworks.** 

**Unfortunately**, it seems that many young adults (and teens even!) are *more excited* about getting **rowdy** than enjoying what Sinulog *really* is meant to be—to **celebrate Jesus** of His childhood as well as to celebrate Cebu. 

I was particularly in disbelief about this especially when celebrating my first-ever Sinulog when my classmates invited me, because along the streets it was really, really crowded. Face paints, splashing of colors, human chains, strangers-turned-friends, and yes, touching other people’s untouchables and binge-drinking. Really unlike many festivals in Mindanao where the fun doesn’t need to involve hard partying, binge-drinking, and all other forms of crazy. If anything, liquor is even banned for the entire duration of those festivals!

I was even more troubled when my classmates back then (and I think even the teens of today) were able to gain access to bars—I mean, how? Do they look ‘old’ enough to be allowed in bars? Don’t the bars check IDs for birthdays? Aren’t the schools doing enough to prevent HS students from entering bars and punish the rule-breakers? ‘Cause indeed, I had some schoolmates get punished for those, but not all of them. 

Have a happy, blissful, and safe Sinulog everyone. Pit Seńor.

1f69oom,Cebu,1 year in Cebu and still no friends,"So nag 1 year+ nako sa Cebu and wala pa gihapon friends here na ma one call away nako lol

I'm a mid 20s introvert and a school-straight-to-home and vice versa type of person. I have acquaintances naman sad from my school but dili siya sa level nga I get invited out or I can invite them out. I was so at peace with my lifestyle kay lagi it was the best way to steer away from drama but lately, it feels kinda lonely to think about it. Murag nag hit siya sako nga maybe I don't like it kay wala koy na invite out sako birthday to celebrate and share my cake with or even have people to grab coffee with just because it's a nice day for a good talk. 

I'm still in contact with my og highschool barkada but lagyo na kaayo mi with kanya kanyang navigate sa adult life. I know very peaceful akong life karon but gimingaw nako kanang naay other people to laugh with and maka chika chika panagsa (except sa chika nga maka bring in og bad energy like backstabbing people). I miss the energy nga naay mag share about their day or receive a random message nga dili lami ilang coffee na order lol. 

Decided to step out of my comfort zone so hey, if naa pamo spot sainyong circle maybe mada pa?? Or maybe a gc or discord is fine just to keep my phone alive?? And clearly, I am NOT looking for a romantic relationship or hook ups. 🥹🥹 Building connections is also a goal.

Dili ko pilian but I'd appreciate it if you understand that if we're out I might need a quick social battery recharge so I'd go quiet for a while then balik og saba saba na after. I am known also as a ""group mom"" so I take care of people when they're drunk and will literally be on the side of the road for you if mutabok sa kalsada. I'm a tall girly so a lot of my girl friends would say that I'm the best person for hugs.

1ktecaf,Cebu,Free STD Treatments and Consultation here in Cebu City,"Hello everyone! If any of you is in need of STD testing, consultation, or treatment and want it for free then, this is for you.

The Cebu City Health Department—Social Hygiene Clinic offers free basic lab tests for HIV, Syphilis, Hepatitis B & C, and Gonorrhea. Results for the first four are available within an hour. Treatment is also free, unless they require more comprehensive and specific lab tests, then those you’ll have to pay for and get it from other labs like Hi-Precision, but at least the primary screening is covered.

If you need printed results or official documentation, there’s a small fee:

Gram Staining (STD Screening) – ₱50 (for Gonorrhea and Trichomoniasis)


Blood Tests:

	•	Syphilis – ₱120
	•	Hep B – ₱130
	•	Hep C – ₱200
	•	HIV – ₱250

Treatment is generally available on-site and still free, unless they run out of stock. They also offer free PrEP if you’re interested.

They’re open weekdays from 8:00 AM to 4:00 PM, and walk-ins are welcome.

They’re probably one of the clinics that don’t usually have heavy foot traffic, so feel free to go directly. If you’re not familiar with the place, just ask the information desk receptionist for directions.

For directions to Cebu City Health Dept itself, its across Carreta Elementary School alongside the Central Nautical Highway. For commuters, jeepneys that usually pass through the area are 10M, 02B, and 01K (as far as I currently know).

Please take advantage of this free service and, as always, practice safe sex. 🙏","free std treatments and consultation here in cebu city hello everyone! if any of you is in need of std testing, consultation, or treatment and want it for free then, this is for you.

I live in a relatively populated prefecture and now and then macompare nako ang pinas and specially our traffic situation iN Cebu. I want to talk about the commute and the railway system. MYYY MYY MYY. The japanese have it perfected to a T! Is this what happens when taxpayer's money is used to its full potential? It's insane how the system works for the people cause in our case it feels like torture ang kada uli from work. I must say what they call Tokyo rush also happens and the trains can get crowded too but it will never be delayed. The driving discipline needs to be studied as well. Ang one car distance kay sa driving school ra nako makita pero here it's everyday.  you rarely see bumper to bumper nga situation. Walking also I think is really encourage and the well maintained sidewalks and bike lanes encourage people to go out and stay active. Not to mention the lush greenery along the road and sidewalks. Bisag asa ka mo lingi naay tanom and theres always a tree to run to when the sun gets a little harsh.

Hi! Mangayo untana ko'g ikatambag ug opinyon ninyo :)

Intro; So taga-Cebu City jud ko. Dira ko nagdako ug 14 ka tuig ko dira nagpuyo apan nibalhin mi'g Agusan del Norte sa dihang nagpandemic (so around 2020). 

Fast forward to today, ug Grade 12 na ko. Duha ang universities nga akong gi-applyan. Una kay ang Cebu Doctor's University ug sa Liceo de Cagayan (for back-up). 

Sa sinugdanan kay sa Cebu jud ang plano. Naa na koy mapuy-an didto. Dili na kaayo gasto (ilabi na sa tubig/kuryente/renta/kaon etc) kay naa koy mga kaparente didto. Mas pamilyar pud ko sa Cebu. 

Con;. Mahal kaayo ang tuition. Kani ra jud ang pinaka-main con nako sa Cebu. Andam mangutang sa bangko akong ginikanan para lang ani, pero dili man ko gusto nga magkautang-utang pa sila. Dili ko gusto nga mahimong karga financiera sa akong pamilya. 

Which leads me to Liceo de Cagayan 

Bale, naa to'y sponsor nako nga nioffer ug scholarship (full) para sa Liceo. Actually wala man jud koy connections sa Cagayan and to keep it simple, niapply rako sa Liceo para naa koy options pero nagduha-duha nako muadtog Cebu kay tungod lagi sa scholarship sa Cagayan. Wala koy friends, family, bisag kinsa nga kaila sa Cagayan. Kausa ra pud ko nakaara dinha. 

Pro; Dili gasto ang tuition kung mag-Cagayan ko, kay lagi scholar man. 

Con: Sa akong course (which is BSPT), gamay ang passing rate sa Liceo sa Board Exams.  33% lang siya, compared to 86% sa Cebu. Dako kaayo siyag diperensya

Honestly speaking, I am having a hard time choosing what university to go to. I hope naay maka-offer ug advice sa inyoha diri :)","cebu vs cagayan - schools also posted in the cdo subreddit;

10gt12d,,,"Hello! Studied at Silliman, my siblings studied at USC. I'll be bias here; I'll share my experience more on SU. No uniform during your undergrad years, unless if you're gonna take up medical courses that would require students to wear uniform on most days. Business courses also require corporate attire for 1 day, as a practice. 

Most colleges in the university have no classes on Monday, because they use it as a free day to catch up on studying, meet up for group work/fieldwork, work on your co-curriculars or an extra day to rest especially if you had a quiz/class on Saturday. Students are really encouraged to be involved in co-curricular activites/joining orgs, para hindi din puro academics lang. 

Even if SU is a Christian school, they welcome all students from different walks of life, race and religion. Wala kaming uniform, yung uniform ko nga is shorts, tshirts, tsinelas. The school is overall chill and environmentally friendly, coz the university is so full of acacia trees and is situated beside the sea. 

As for academics, diskarte talaga siya. Center of excellence ang SU sa medical courses like Nursing, MT and PT, but maximize any opportunity to succeed and shine in school whenever you can. I graduated with a liberal arts degree, pero I was also active in the school orgs para may scholarship din ako. You can also work parttime as a student assistant. And during my stay, grabe talaga yung influence nila in helping students appreciate art, music and culture. Most local artists in Dumaguete are students/graduates from SU, so they're trying to make the city a lively cultural spot. 

Overall, I enjoyed my stay in Silliman. I was able to focus in my academics because the less yung pollution, university-city yung Dumaguete, and I got to make friends from ppl all over the world and still keep in touch and know local artists. Sa sobrang liit ng Dumaguete at ng university, you get to know everyone in just a short period. 

As for USC, I can't deny that they're one of the best universities outside Manila. But I avoided USC because of the growing traffic in Cebu, the pollution, the tuition, the uniform and the huge crowd of the uni. For my personality, parang naghahanap kasi ako ng ""chill"" atmosphere so pinili ko yung Silliman. 

But hey, that's just my opinion and experience. Even if you're gonna graduate from these universities, study well and enjoy your college life while it lasts. Don't depend too much on the school name, it's really how you'll carry yourself during and after you graduate.

On the other hand, USC is way ahead in terms of engineering, hard sciences, law, and business. SU has more level IV accredited programs. While USC beats it in number of CHED center of excellence/development programs. 

Silliman has a smaller and close-knit community with laid back and chill campus vibes. While USC has urban campuses with bigger student body. SU has plenty of well maintained historical classroom buildings, older than my grandparents, which gives off American colleges vibes. Objectively, in terms of campus aesthetics, SU wins hands down.

Tuition in USC is slightly more expensive. Idk maybe because it’s in a major city. SU has more need-based and merit-based scholarships. In sports, USC excels a lot better. What SU lacks in college athletics, it makes up for its great culture and arts scenes, it’s the best outside Metro Manila. 

Overall, it’s a matter of personal preference. Both schools are highly reputable for sure. You can’t go wrong either way academically.

So far naman, based sa moments na I've spent with them regarding their program, it's overall good din.

One parent na alumnus ng Psych department even organized a get together with her batchmates sa Pysch, and their teachers (who are still teaching sa SU) joined them! I don't know how would you define if its really good or something kasi since wala namang malalaking laboratories needed or pataasang buildings for Psych program. But if exposure-wise, sobrang-sobrang exposed sila sa internship days nila, kahit saan facility na alam ko within the City, may experience sila tapos may mga insightful takeaways pa. Downside lang, is since probinsya, di Cebu-level yung place, so yung exposure pang ganun din. BUT it's not really bad at all talaga, high-rise buildings lang ang lamang ng Cebu parang ganun.

You mean ""does **not** seem to include that the group stayed there willingly""?

Not sure if that amounts to kidnapping that needed the rescuing by police or soldiers and the arrest of volunteers.

These are bakwits. Refugees. And a lot of schools and the Catholic church were involved in this program, and minors are being returned in batches because there is this thing that makes us stay in our homes (especially minors and senior citizens), **against our will**, called ""COVID protocol.""

Probably the police wanted to arrest the volunteer leftists included in their world-class intel gathering, got hold of the parents of the kids, told them that their kids are being brainwashed and being turned into NPA fighters, and then the police went to the retreat house for a ""rescue operation.""

This is almost the same bullshit that the police pulled against [Satur Ocampo and Rep. France Castro in 2018](https://www.rappler.com/nation/satur-ocampo-france-castro-arrested-november-2018).

A more accurate value of the Cisco 7000 back in 1994 would be $19,900 or around Php550,000 without a Silicon SwitchProcessor, and in 2024, that amount would be worth $41,670 or a little over 2 million pesos.

llsaf7,,,"Sa mga bundok, far away from the city usually in provinces that has less civilization. This campus lies in between 2 major cities, Cebu City and Mandaue city. It's pretty much in an urban center. The University has 5 campuses and the Talamban Campus is a 78 hectare campus with a mountain or hills in the area. It houses several Campuses both undergraduate and Graduate colleges. It's also known as a Capitalist University, so tagging it a Communist front is like a joke. It's far from what NPA would go to, since it's a very expensive school in the City that one can easily track. An example of a University that the NPA would go to is UP Mindanao in Davao. Very far off the city and near mountainous regions with very less populated towns in the area. Acquaintances I know who graduated from UP MIN have known former schoolmates joining the NPA cause and even dying in an encounter with the military. It's an easy target since some of the students are scholars and have background that can easily be manipulated into their cause.

Also, the Lumad students spoke about their education. They were taught the basics, to read and write after their schools were closed down and destroyed. It's one of their advocacies to restore their schools in Mindanao. Also one of the Datus was with them and was shocked why the raid happened. They have been in Cebu since 2019 because of this Outreach program and this is not exclusive to USC as they also went to different schools for other activities. The Datu said that they were scheduled to go home last April 2020, however, during that time, Cebu was in total lockdown as it was the province that had a most number of cases (even the governor of Cebu losing 2 siblings from it). They were housed in the USC Retreat Area. The Datu actually reached out to DSWD and they have submitted a letter for assistance since traveling to Mindanao had a lot of requirements including very expensive swab tests that they have no money for. DSWD didn't give them a response according to the Datu and just found themselves part of this ""rescue"" Operation. Sure, the parents are worried since the children have been there longer than expected, but that doesn't mean it's an NPA ploy. One of the reasons for this ""rescue"" was because one of the volunteer teachers that was arrested was a graduate of UP and was an activist against anti-terror law. He's an activist who was redtagged before by the Police as he was also part of the protesters against martial law in Mindanao in 2017. He was a volunteer math teacher to Lumads in Mindanao and was known to write about his experiences and topics such as militarization of Lumad communities in Mindanao. It seems he was the target, and they accused USC as a communist front to make things easier.",,6,,,1613619360.0,2021-02-18 11:36:00,IllustriousLychee13,,,,True,4,9,8,0,21,"['bisaya', 'tagalog', 'conyo']",5,21,comment,0.08230639730639731,0.48122053872053877,neutral,1,0,gnuhq7e,t1_gnud0xz,True
