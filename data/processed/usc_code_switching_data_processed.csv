lvc98o,Philippines,Where do you buy electronics and other things?,"Hi guys, I am an American who was visiting the Philippines back in 2019 for about 3 weeks. I recently gained my dual citizenship and looking forward to probably living in Cebu City after college. Coming from the USA, I do my shopping pretty much online. I mainly shop on Amazon for electronics and other goods like home appliances. This allows me to not really leave my home except to buy groceries and such. As far as I can tell when I visited the Philippines, most people go to the malls to buy their stuff. Is there a Philippine version of Amazon that offers just as much items as Amazon has on their website or is the mall the best option to shop for electronics and other things. I would love to know.
